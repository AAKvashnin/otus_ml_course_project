XXXX at the time explained my options One of the options was to do a forbearance I agreed that this would be the best solution to my hardship They said they would send out the paperwork that I needed to fill out and return by the end of XXXX I agreed to the terms and to the contract After I sent it in they sent back the approval and the Forbearance would start on XX XX XXXXand end at the end of XXXX and at that time I could decide to do a modification or refinance my loan my payment would be for the amount of XXXX at the first of every month until XXXX I called in the first payment and it was a check for the amount of XXXX It was written from my church XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and banked through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I was abler to get a confirmation that it was accepted I then sent my second payment for the amount of XXXX No problems It wasn t until the end of XXXX that I received letter stating my forbearance was terminated due to a routing number They stated that they must receive a letter from the bank confirming that the routing number had not changed I called immediately to see what they were talking about They could not give me any information except to dispute it and reapply for another forbearance I sent a dispute a couple days latter to the fax number they given me to send my dispute A couple weeks later I received the papers to do another forbearance I then called weekly to follow up I called weekly from XXXX to XXXX I would call and they would tell me everything looks great XXXX XXXX not to worry that it is in the process and to call again in another week to follow up or find out the results After numerous calls and frustration I was able to get a answer after demanding and waiting on the phone over 2 hours the young lady came on and said sorry She said she was sorry for both the forbearance and my dispute being turned down I asked why and she couldn t give me a answer In the dispute I sent a letter from the bank a copy of the check and all the other information to show that the routing number was good no changes and the check was good XXXX never tried to put the check through this is from the bank that covered the check XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX cancelled my forbearance without calling or notifying me until almost 3 months later I didn t have any idea that my forbearance was cancelled until months later or that XXXX never tried to put the check through the bank I was devastated and continued to do everything I could to work with XXXX and to show them this was not any of my fault I spent 3 months waiting and calling continually every week to solve and get answers to this dilemma All this time they were telling me not to worry that it seemed to them it would go through I even ask for supervisors and Managers to help or get involved I only received from the customer service that a supervisor would go through all the calls and recordings and get back with me I received nothing In XXXX after I was told that the forbearance and the dispute was turned down that if I couldn t come up with the arrearages that foreclosure would start I was beside myself My new wife couldn t handle it and we separated we had to tell our children they were devastated I received a letter from XXXX stating that they have sent it to a foreclosure attorney and I needed to contact them The XXXX week of XXXX I receive another letter stating that XXXX is longer involved That they sold or sent my loan to a new company called XXXX It stated that the loan will be with XXXX starting XXXX and that I would need t contact them and not XXXX I ve contacted XXXX I even did a modification when I spoke to XXXX told them what has been going on they stated that it did not matter because I was now with them I asked them about my modification and they stated it probably wont go through and I should try and sell as soon as I can They also told me that I need to contact the attorneys involved I ask the name and phone and it was the same foreclosure attorney as XXXX There shouldn t be any reason why this is happening If XXXX would of deposited the check my forbearance would of never been cancelled It doesn t make any sense why they didn t even try and after knowing that there wasn t any problems they didn t do anything to help and they got gave my loan to another company without resolving any of the issues XXXX also wasted 3 to 4 months getting back with me or answering anything to do with the forbearance or dispute They added late fees and added appraisal fees added for a person to come to the home continuously to see if it was occupied by us and I m not sure but I also think that they charged to to the forbearance or redo the loan They told me to hold off in making any payments until the issues were resolved I don t understand why they keep me going on for months why did it take months why couldn t anyone give me any answer until months later My family and I are devastated and don t understand why they would do this Please investigate or help us in this serious matter Thank you XXXX XXXX

I am having some difficulties obtaining information regarding my 3 Capital One credit cards in restricted status I contacted the Capital One call center on XX XX 2019 the offshore representative said she would not obtain any details since it was with the Fraud Department but I was going to need to provide 3 documents for them to review I was not willing to provide documents without more insight into what was happening or the issue being investigated I asked to be transferred if a Supervisor but after waiting on hold for over 8 minutes I disconnected the call I contacted the Capital One call center on XX XX 2019 I was routed through the auto dialer to the Fraud Department The representative was polite but unable to give me any detailed information about the status of my accounts He explained I would need to provide a picture of my Oregon Driver s License via a secure email link Upon review I would receive a phone call advising on the status of my accounts I received the email took 4 pictures of my ODL and attached to the secured link and received a confirmation message indicating the transmission was successful I contacted the Capital One call center on XX XX 2019 I was routed through the auto dialer to the Fraud Department XXXX I voiced my frustration about not receiving any status on the review nor a call as indicated by the XX XX 2019 rep XXXX advised no documents were received and provided a little more detail into possibilities of someone else attempting to retrieve or access my account He did not or could not provide specifics He sent me a new link to provide my documents and waiting on the call with me to confirm receipt He was not able to confirm receipt since the documents again were not received He was going to consult another party to confirm if there was a technical issue to explain why my documents were not being received Then the call disconnected I can not begin to express to you how perplexing concerning and frustrating this has become to me as a long standing Capital One customer I may not have thousands of dollars of CC activity each year but I am definitely a customer who pays their bills and is paying monthly interest on my credit cards I NEED someone to explain to me the specifics of the current restricted status of my accounts I NEED someone to confirm receipt of my previous 2 submissions I do not think it is too much to ask especially since it is MY personal information Capital One is requesting and asking me to compile without giving me any details It is an odd way to do business and definitely lacks transparency I noticed the restricted message on my Capital One mobile app when I was checking the status of my autopay There has been no verbal or written outreach by Capital One to me to advise or inform about the status of my account either

On XX XX 2019 I was notified by the credit fraud alert that a account was placed on my credit profile with a company XXXX I have been a victim of Identity theft and the credit report notifies me everytime someone trys to or has opened a account I put this alert on my credit report due to the fact that my roomate had stole personal indentity information and has been using to open up diferent lines of credit in my name I filed a police report and reports with the FTC IC3 and my local police department I do not understand how this account was opened because it clearly states in all three credit reports to reach out to me to verifiy any new accounts being open My roomate stole my information from my home while he was still my roomate last winter in XXXX to be correct He was using my identity from XXXX to I do not even know for how long as I have to keep checking my report I can not belive this is happening to me and never thought that someone could be as heartless and uncaring to do something like this The event I do not know where it happen I only know when he took my information was tiime he was kicked out for not being able to pay his rent I have reached out to XXXX and have tried to file this report like three times now and it keeps not going through On the XXXX claim website and everytime I call I just get transfered around Also XXXX wants me to show them my ID and I do not feel ok with this as I am a victim of Identity theft If they do not have a copy on file of my ID then pretty much they know it was not me opening up a account The credit report companys told me to file a police report and so I filed reports with local police ftc ic3 and I told each company to put a block on this account as it was not mine but they failed to do so this is against FCRA rules my credit is not something I want to be incorrect as this makes me look bad for jobs credit ect

Our mortgage loan was transferred from XXXX XXXX to LoanCare before our first payment was due We received a goodbye letter from XXXX XXXX on XX XX XXXX and our first payment was due on XX XX XXXX We had not received a welcome letter from LoanCare prior to our first payment being due so we went ahead and set up a payment through our bank s XXXX bill pay system using the information provided by XXXX XXXX regarding where to send our payments and our new servicer loan number The payment was sent on XX XX XXXX and was delivered on XX XX XXXX The payment in the amount of 1200 00 came out of our bank account on XX XX XXXX and the payment was accepted by LoanCare so it was not returned to us On XX XX XXXX we received our welcome packet from LoanCare Upon reading it we realized that XXXX XXXX had given us the incorrect new servicer loan number They had omitted one number from the loan number in error I called LoanCare to see if our payment had been received and they claimed that it had not likely as a result of the wrong account number being included on the payment we sent I ve been working with XXXX XXXX and LoanCare to try to get LoanCare to search for our payment to have it properly applied to our account However LoanCare is refusing to search without a copy of our bank statement which is not currently available until the end of the month I have provided them with our transaction history showing the payment to LoanCare and that we had sufficient funds in our account when the payment was made as well as proof of payment from XXXX that outlines the transaction details and they are refusing to help locate the payment If they were not going to search to have our payment applied to the correct account they should not have accepted the electronic payment in the first place so that we wouldn t have to do all of the leg work to prove we made the payment Also XXXX XXXX should have made sure that they sent us the correct information regarding our new loan servicer and our new loan number As a result of their error we are dealing with our payment being late despite sending it in on time and having to jump through hoops to try to get LoanCare to locate our payment I spoke to the CFO of XXXX XXXX on XX XX XXXX and she admitted that they had become aware of the mistake about 3 weeks ago when they went to wire our escrow money to LoanCare and LoanCare told them they had the incorrect loan number However no one had contacted us to notify us of the error and I only realized upon receiving our information from LoanCare a week after we had already made the payment I am worried that this will not get resolved before our 60 day grace period during the transition between servicers and that LoanCare will attempt to charge us for a late payment and report the late payment to the credit bureaus despite us having paid on time and the fact that the error in the account loan number was no fault of our own I have attached the transaction history for our bank account showing the payment to LoanCare on XX XX XXXX as well as the proof of payment provided to me by XXXX that outlines the details of the transaction of our payment to LoanCare 
On XX XX XXXX BoA told me that they would refund three months worth of the monthly maintenance fees I was charged They send me a check for the incorrect amount when I requested my account be closed They told me on XX XX XXXX that because my account was closed they were unable to correct their check issuance error and as a result they were keeping my money They informed me that they did see that I was told the fees would be refunded but that they had no way to give me the funds It s absurd and should be illegal

During several dates I have sent certified mail to the credit bureaus asking them to verify the inaccuracies of the information on the bankruptcy they are reporting On my report it lists the liabilities and assets being 0 00 This is not accurate and you can see this highlighted on the report attached On several dates I received the response from the bureau stating they verified the information I then sent a letter to the XXXX County Court Clerk s office asking if they verified the information to the bureaus They sent me a letter stating that they do not provide information to the bureaus The XXXX creditor was sent a letter for verification and validation and they have not responded to my request and have exceeded the mandatory 30 day time limit XXXX XXXX was also contacted and has not sent verification My complaint is this I challenged the Items based upon the inaccurate reporting of the 0 00 assets and 0 00 Liabilities on my report for the BK Pertaining to the XXXX account they have not responded to certified mail and confirmed verification and validation of their inaccurate reporting The XXXX XXXX account jumps instantly into 60 day late reporting mark but does not say a 30 day period was breached I have also added proof that these bureaus are not doing a true verification and supplying relevant proof while not flippantly dismissing the FCRA mandated rules The bureaus also refuse to provide and form of evidence there for proving their verification The Bureaus claimed that they had verified the information when clearly they could not have for two reasons for the BK 1 it is impossible to have a bankruptcy and have 0 00 liabilities and 0 00 assets reported 2 the bureaus claimed they verified the information yet the source of the information sent me a letter that they do not verify information with the courts Also I put a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX report yet they used that agency NO third party can verify per FCRA as a third party This leads me to conclude that the credit bureaus never conducted a reasonable investigation on this inaccurate information for the BK For the XXXX account they have not responded to my request for validation and verification and time has lapsed past 30 days In my certified mail I also requested they remove any inquiries that are not currently associated to any account The credit bureaus also said they verified the information but can t provide any proof If they do have proof they have not provided that to me after many requests I would like to have this inaccurate records removed from my credit report as it is reporting inaccurately and incomplete on my report

XXXX this year two big expenses came up one the air broke during 100 degree weather and second my horse of 26 years got ill and then died The Ac cost 2400 00 the death of horse 1000 00 Together they pushed my finances over my limits I began by borrowing what use to be called a payday loan but is now called a flex Loan This got to be so expensive that I quite foolishly took out another to pay the first This became EIGHT 8 loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX type high interest lenders In XXXX I finally decided to address the issues with each one Up until that point I had not missed any payments I CLOSED the bank account that I had been using to pay them by auto debit A new card was issued also So I began contacting ALL lenders to make payment arrangements that would make everyone happy and to let them know I was NOT TRYING TO SKIP MY BILL just pay smaller amount for longer period and HOPE they might lower interest rates The first lender XXXX stated I owed 780 00 and they would drop it to 350 00 if I paid in 2 payments which I did However the first and biggest interest lender XXXX was the second lender I called It has NOT turned out well XXXX HAS STOLED XXXX from my new bank account I DID NOT authorize this payment On XX XX XXXX I called them and asked for help consideration in giving me more time and smaller payments I stated I could only pay them 200 00 per month and was willing to give them the 200 00 payment at that moment by phone This was on the NEW debit card that WAS NOT part of any agreement I had with them They took the 200 00 that night XX XX XXXX However on the second of XXXX a huge almost 400 00 amount was deducted from my new bank account by XXXX I immediately called my bank and went to see local manager to REVERSE this as unauthorized Bank manager stated that since I gave authorized them the 200 00 in XXXX they were allowed to take this XXXX out in XX XX XXXX How can I dispute my own bank I will NOT be staying with them if that is their logic If that were the case any and every payment I ever made to ANYONE could use my debit info and STEAL whatever they wanted from my bank account This is asinine I want the bank to recover my funds ASAP I have since called more lenders and all have been amenable to other arrangements that work out for everyone included a 60 day window no fees and weekly payments instead of monthly When I asked XXXX if they would TAKE unauthorized from my bank other than what we agreed on she XXXX stated that unauthorized payments were illegal and they would not do that and that I should call police and my bank and file charges To me it is stealing I an trying very hard to do they right thing Therefore all other entities should also be required to Including my own bank XXXX XXXX XXXX out of XXXX Tn There should be laws preventing this theft of funds by any entity Just because I approve ONE payment does not mean any payment they feel like taking If that was the case XXXX would be dipping into my bank account and the electric company and anyone I do business with Please help Thank you for your attention to this serious matter XXXX XXXX

Bank of America the Bank violated the federal Expedited Funds Availability Act Regulation CC also the Act by failing to make available the funds of a check made by XXXX XXXX XXXX the Maker drawn on the Bank that I deposited in my own checking account at the Bank The Bank failed to release the funds within the time periods required under the Act and failed to provide the notice required under the Act when the funds are not made available The checks Maker and I each complained to the CFPB about the Banks law violation on XX XX XXXX and XX XX 2018 The Banks legal department responded to our complaints but as the attached correspondence demonstrates the Bank fails to recognize the clear law violations Here are the facts On XX XX 2018 I deposited the Makers check in the amount of 350 00 payable to me at the Banks branch in XXXX XXXX Virginia None of the funds from that check were made available to me on that day The ATM notice stated A hold was placed on your check s because check specific information indicates that the item may be returned The Notice also stated that the entire amount of the funds would be available by XXXX XXXX on XX XX 18 However none of the funds were available to me when I went to the Banks XXXX XXXX branch in the morning of XX XX 18 The branch personnel told me that the Bank needed to verify that the funds would be available from the Makers checking account However that was untrue because the Bank had already debited the Makers checking account on XX XX 2018 See the attached check The funds were not available to me until XX XX 2018 Thus the Bank extended the hold on my check funds for one week until XX XX 2018 after the check was debited to the Makers checking account In response to my complaint to the CFPB the Bank sent the attached letter dated XX XX 2018 the XX XX XXXX letter This letter does not satisfy me or the Maker of this check for the following reasons Because the check was written on the Makers checking account at Bank of America and there was no other financial institution involved there was no reason for the Bank to place an extended hold on my check In fact the funds cleared the Makers checking account on the day that I deposited the check in the Banks ATM Under the Expedited Funds Availability Act the Bank was required to make at least 200 00 of the 320 00 deposited check available for my withdrawal by the next business day following the day of deposit which was XX XX 2018 12 CFR 229 10 c 1 vii When the Bank failed to do so on that date it was subject to the Acts requirements for extended holds under 12 CFR 229 13 That section states Sections 229 10 c and 229 12 do not apply to a check deposited in an account at a depository bank if the depository bank has reasonable cause to believe that the check is uncollectible from the paying bank Reasonable cause to believe a check is uncollectible requires the existence of facts that would cause a well grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person Such belief shall not be based on the fact that the check is of a particular class or is deposited by a particular class of persons The reason for the bank s belief that the check is uncollectible shall be included in the notice required under paragraph g of this section 12 CFR 229 13 g However because the funds had already been debited from the Makers checking account at the Bank the Bank had no reasonable cause to believe that the funds would be unavailable The Banks XX XX XXXX letter claims that a notice dated XX XX 2018 was mailed to my home address informing me of the freeze on my deposit The notice does not state when the freeze will be lifted and instructs me to contact the person who gave you this item to resolve this matter Inasmuch as the funds had already be debited for the the person who gave you this item i e the Maker the Maker would have been completely unable to resolve this matter I never received this notice or any other written notice from the bank regarding the extended hold on my deposited check However this notice violates the Expedited Funds Availability Act in the following respects It does not give the reason for the extended hold and it does not state the time period within which the funds will be available for withdrawal 12 CFR 229 13 g 1 The Banks XX XX XXXX letter states that the extended freeze was placed on the check because the ATM reported that there was an issue reading the MICR line on the check which indicated that it was possible that the check would be returned unpaid This explanation makes no sense for the following reasons 1 The funds had already been paid when the Bank debited the account of the Makers checking account at the Bank and 2 the copy of the check which was included in the Banks XX XX XXXX letter shows that the MICR is completely readable In any event that reason was never given to the Maker or to me If we had had that reason I could have shown the Bank personnel the copy of the cashed check which the Maker gave to me My experience and the Banks response to the complaint that the Maker and I submitted to the CFPB demonstrate that the Bank has a policy and practice of violating the Expedited Funds Availability Act

them to correct this issue I made NUMEROUS phone calls about this each time I was promised it would be changed and a new card would be sent to me Then when I was signing in online to make a minimum payment on this card I could NOT do it as the primary card was a MUST to sign in and I did not have that card only had possession of an alternate card XXXX XXXX This allowed charges to go onto the card and yet American Express had NO WAY to allow me to go online and make a payment without the card with my full name which Am Ex had NOT even sent out until just before the bill was due I then went online XX XX XXXX and registered the card in my account with the help of Am Ex as each time I went to make a payment on the online service under that card the website of Am Ex would flip me to a different card of mine In other words I would just about press send and then notice the screen reload and show a different card was going to receive that payment which was 200 00 which was greater than the minimum Am Ex requested So I went to an online chat session with Am Ex and explained to them what was going on While they were attempting to help me perhaps they did fix something as I was still attempting to make the payment as I was between the chat response times THEN at one point it took the payment of 200 00 to the card which it was due as I observed NO reloading of web page I then moved on in conversation with the chat to addressing my card having the wrong name on it and was informed a new card would arrive within 7 10 days it arrived in XXXX Fast forward to XX XX XXXX I had another online chat session and was question why I was seeing a minimum payment due of 5200 00 and I stated in the chat that this card did NOT have a interest until XXXX and why was I seeing interest charges This person had a few more comments as I told him I could not verify my card because the online visual request and showing me where security numbers were on the card that this card did not have them We went back and forth and then the Am Ex representative put his supervisor on the chat I offered to send the supervisor a photo of my card to prove to him no security codes was present as informed to locate I also informed him of the card billing issues I was having and the amount of requested payment being wrong This supervisor informed me that he was going to open a case Here is what I ll do for you I ll go ahead and open a case on your account so that our team can look into the matter We then talked about what is going wrong with my account he wanted me to call in to work it out and I wanted to resolve it in written form in the chat He confirmed they were waiving the interest fee which I thought was in error all along as it was not as I understood the agreement I understood only minimum payment due without interest and that they would extend the line of credit as I needed it NEVER did I understand that anything above 4000 00 would be required in FULL or I would pay interest and late fees on that amount I contracted with Am Ex over the phone with an agent that had trouble speaking or understanding English as I recall I had to keep going over answers and issues with her This is the chat Id XXXX from this XX XX XXXX conversation Then we moved onto the problem with the card and how could we resolve my issues I have screenshots of the entire chat if needed This supervisor insisted that I call in and speak with someone I did that while he was still on the chat and ultimately discontinued the chat with this online chat representative I was also confirming that the minimum we sent to come out each month went from 200 00 to 500 00 per month this was so I could knock down the balance before the XXXX interest due deadline Recall I believed this card was NOT charging interest until XXXX This is a quote I just saw from the live chat Your introductory APR for new purchases posted to your account by XXXX is 0 00 through your billing period ending in XXXX After that your APR will be a variable rate of the Prime Rate 7 99 currently 13 24 This is how I understood this agreement and not how the last phone call I had with a supervisor explained it to me She informed me that anything OVER 4000 00 would be due in FULL or interest would be charged and a late fee Please locate that phone call records as she informed me phone calls are recorded and told me I would have to take them to court to listen to them she said this in an aggressive way as the phone call will reveal If you listen to the phone call it will be revealed that Am Ex set me up on this card deal that they ALWAYS had BAD INTENSIONS of suckering me into paying interest and penalty fees That the limit they gave to me was 4000 00 YET told me I would only have to make the minimum payment please find recordings of the agreement when card was first agreed to at one point in contacting Am Ex after I realized that the numbers did not make sense That is I had to spend 5000 00 within 3 months but I only had to make minimum payments on this card They informed me that the card does not have a limit and it is okay and no interest until XXXX please check the phone recordings during the time I made purchases from a landscape supply house that is when I was set at ease Fast forward to me and the late fees and I contacted them via chat today informing them that this card has to be fixed chat records exist Then going onto the supervisor on the phone and ONLY TODAY did I realize that anything above 4k I will owe in FULL or a later fee and interest would be charged I informed the supervisor that American Express is running a scam that if I made the minimum payment on XXXX card limit which she verified to be 40 00 per month and SO if I was to make the minimum payment as this card was promoted to me as only minimum payment no interest card that NO way could I EVER get the XXXX XXXX rewards points as I would NOT be able to get to the minimum 5000 00 in charges in 3 months WITHOUT going over the limit of 4000 00 they gave me ALSO keep in mind I have an 800 plus credit score and I was totally shocked over the silly 4000 00 limit the offered BUT NOW it is clear why they did that to cause this DRAMA and perhaps it works with a lot of people and maybe only one or two bite back I am biting back as I am sure this card was set up and offered to cause this issue I have NOT to this day received any written card requirements all they sent me was a card on a glued paper I ask the help of CFPB to correct this error on Am Ex part Please note I did ask the supervisor to please give me further access to a higher level supervisor before I would make this complaint and she informed me that all she could give me was a an address in XXXX XXXX Texas to write and complain and that she was writing a formal complaint about my issues but that NO ONE would be contacting me about her written complaint Further NO ONE has contacted me about any issues from the promised date back in XX XX XXXX the 6 8 weeks turn around time has not happened as of yet This error put a hardship on me as it has caused me MANY hours of communicating with Am Ex and only today I realized their scam I asked the supervisor tonight to simple allow my auto payment of 500 00 per month to pay down the card in a timely manner and I would NO longer use the card as it did so The supervisor said she could remove the late fee and that was all Again this is not fair to me as consumer and I ask for your help 
I have a loan with WFDS I have always made my payments on time For some reason I realized that there was a late payment on my credit report As you can see I have always had a stellar payment record with this company I tried contacting both XXXX XXXX and WFDS with no successful resolution XXXX and XXXX were reporting me late There was definitely an error on their part I was never 30 days late XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX

I received a foreclosure letter several months ago in XXXX It was showing missed payments but not on correct dates After finally figuring this out through my lawyer the payments were caught up to date and the payment went directly through the law firm so there was a definite payoff trail In a letter dated XX XX XXXX it is stating we know have a forecloser date of XX XX XXXX stating again the old amount and saying there has been no payment since I have the payoff that my lawyer sent directly as well as every cleared check for each month after Before we were on autopay and never had this problem As soon as we filed bankruptcy they canceled that even though no other company did This was simply an opportunity for this company to hope we defaulted due to our perfect auto debit record so they could take advantage I would appreciate as I have already told this company to have my auto debit reinstated and my account open to me If my account can not be accessed how am I suppose to know what has been paid and when it cleared Closing access to my account due to bankruptcy that does not even affect this company is absurd They are only trying to take advantage of a hard situation Attached is the payoff in XXXX as well as the additional three payments the company is claiming I missed You can clearly see all payments are made and have cleared my bank

Nationstar s response to the CFPB is a blatant lie Here is why In XXXX of 2018 my insurance company XXXX issued a new policy which required Nationstar to issue a check to pay for the homeowner s policy The policy was incorrect and XXXX issued a second policy in XXXX to correct the incorrect policy Nationstar sent a second check to XXXX to account for the two policies Nationstar know this is what actually caused the erroneous escrow amount I was never notified by Nationstar about the two policy payments until I called Nationstar never worked with XXXX to reconcile the right account policy and I never received a letter from Nationstar about my escrow account The back dated letter they provided you is apparently a fraudulent letter because unless they can provide that the postal office delivered a letter they are lying Additionally I received a refund from XXXX for the two policies in XXXX without any notice or explanation for why I got 4100 00 for my policy I was told my Nationstar s escrow department that I did not need to repay the money because the amount is reflected in my mortgage payment Nationstar and my insurance company XXXX failed to inform me of these mistakes and did not involve me in the resolution My credit history should not be impacted by their incompetence and their explanation is typical of Nationstar Its a lie All they need to do reverse the inaccurate credit report Mortgage Loan XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Rhode Island XXXX I writing this complaint because Mr Cooper formerly Nationstar is either fraudulently or incorrectly reporting to reporting agencies that my mortgage payment is late when in fact the payment is not late Furthermore there is no outstanding or pending payment required for my account Additionally my escrow account is incorrect and does not reflect accruals for homeowners insurance Mr Cooper has changed its name but its fraudulent business practices have continued right where Nationstar left off I hope that you will contact the firm and address this on my behalf

am living in my residence in XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX XX XXXX This house was purchased on home loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX XX XXXX The mortgage was later transferred to new creditor Wells Fargo Bank N A on XXXX according to the paperwork Since XXXX Wells Fargo is the service holder for our property and we were making our monthly installments to the bank on time I have neither missed nor was late on a single monthly payment in the last 10 years upon purchasing my house In the meantime during XXXX I became sick and subsequently XXXX My wife also got laid off Looking forward to imminent default on monthly payments on the house I requested the Wells Fargo Bank on XX XX XXXX to modify the monthly payment by reducing the interest rate and increasing number of installments according to the predefined regulations At that time I was paying 6 interest on house loan The Bank informed me over the phone that unless I become default in my monthly payment they can not modify the loan Accordingly upon advised I stopped the payment Well Fargo offered me a temporary payment plan forbearance for six months XX XX XXXX till XX XX XXXX I paid those timely and accurately After finishing my payments the Wells Fargo bank never contacted me After calling them several about 50 to 100 phone calls times to know the status on modifications Wells Fargo mentioned that the person who was handling my case is no longer available and misplaced my 42 pages worth of documents that I initially provided to demonstrate the possibility of financial hardship requesting payment scheme modification Hence the bank gave me another forbearance plan for four months starting XX XX XXXX to XX XX XXXX The revised payment was affordable and I paid those timely and accurately too During the payment period I called them on several occasions to know the status of a permanent modification on my installments The representatives of Wells Fargo informed me that they are working to give me permanent modification soon I made the last payment on XX XX XXXX A few things had to be considered at this stage which I came to know later that Wells Fargo did not assume ownership of the mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX till XX XX XXXX Yet they issued a forbearance plan to us prior to that and never provided us with a decisive outcome As I was settling down with the hope of a better affordable mortgage plan to secure my only home which the permanent modification may bring forth as a result of Wells Fargo Banks temporary assessment on us the bank decided to hold off any plans and we received no indication upon the acceptance of such plan or continuation of previous plan or any new scheme Despite the hardship in this difficult economic times we had to accept any plans provided even if it meant the original mortgage plan would hold As this is our only home Yet trying to contact the authorities handling my case at Wells Fargo we received vague responses and no definite plans were presented to us However we were assured each time that a payment modification is under processing Surprisingly I received letters dated XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX from Wells Fargo Bank attorney requesting for loan payments of the sum of all the unpaid installments to that date It seems to me that hundreds of our communication of past one and half years went into a black hole While all the time promising to elevate the payment plan the bank in a whim not only refused to do any modifications but also to exacerbate the situation has issued notice to pay all the dues to that day due to defaults and reduced temporary plans improvised by Wells Fargo representative themselves This was not only unjustifiable as all these times I was trying to negotiate into a more affordable mortgage plan to secure my only home and the subsequent events followed was also a result due to the banks temporary schemes they were testing out on us However the amount withstanding of about US XXXX at that point was quite unexpected and not affordable to be paid in one time It seemed clearly a plan devised the handlers of my case at Wells Fargo to land me into a irrecoverable situation and thereby making me lose my only living place It left me with no choice but to hire the following law firm to handle my case That caused more hardship XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX UT XXXX Phone XXXX Phone XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This company solicited my business and told me that they will negotiate with the Wells Fargo bank and gave me verbal guarantee that if they can not modify my loan they will refund 5000 00 that they took initially She failed to negotiate owing to the Banks erratic representation and misinformation to the dealing party Even on the sale date of my house Wells Fargo assured our attorney and me that they are working on modifying my loan payment I can not believe how my helplessness way preyed upon in making ridicule double timing me of my only home at this old age while all the time falsely assuring me I feel betrayed by the Banks behavior that pushed me to eventually lose my property in front of my own eye I was victimized of their corporate schemes On the day of the sale XX XX XXXX I have found out that my house is sold and I need to leave my house I was not given any recoverable position or opportunity to keep my home They Wells Fargo Bank eventually won in leading me into this situation taking advantage of my XXXX and financial conditions which led me to approach them for a better plan Instead of helping me out of my situation the Bank quite tactfully using several diplomacy and even resorting to direct fraud in violation of transfer agreements and other mortgage terms stripped me off my dwelling place I am not the only victim Thousands of honest and cooperative houseowners had fallen for this scheme in which approaching assistance from bank in modification of their payment eventually ended up making them homeless In my case the fraud went as far by the Wells Fargo Bank representatives as to even change the ownership of the loan by voiding our deed with the loan providing authority XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and changing the ownership my putting earlier dates on the deed opposed to following any federal procedures As of today no one told me that my modification requests did not go through There is a case pending I want to keep my house my only home I am begging for your help to communicate with the Wells Fargo Bank for not to steal my house I have done everything they asked me to do in order to modify the loan and I have dont them accordingly and timely even in payments I was always careful and myself went forward request modification with fear that I may potentially default I tried all these and yet the manipulative authority bend every action against me in bringing the situation to an outcome so unfavorable Without giving me a reason they have taken my house and buried me with more legal fees I want to keep my house and pay them what I initially owed them Currently XXXX XXXX phone number XXXX from Wells Fargo is handling my case In one hand she told my attorney that she is still trying to modify my loan On the other hand I received a letter from the trustees attorney and Wells Fargos attorney same person that we have to leave the house in 10 days I have all the supporting documents of my complaint We have paid all our earnings toward this house in the past ten or more years and are still willing to carry out the payments monthly I am told that I need an income generating member living with me listening to this my eldest son and his family has moved in with us to prevent the foreclosure and to help towards repayment of the installments We are willing to pay the mortgage payments as before but asking us to pay the difference immediately would make it really difficult for us However the Bank seem to have no interest on dealing with us it knows that we have already pain most of the interests and by evicting us it may claim the whole of the reappraisal value of the property from the government agency HUD which undertakes the mortgage to middleclass families We are willing to pay yet the opportunity is not provided by the bank and the ones that are notified are ridiculous to perceive at this economic condition To the managing people at Wells Fargo the house at XXXX XXXX XXXX is just another property to make substantial gain upon by expelling the present residents But to us it is our home the only ties to a secure old age so many memories and we are down to last teardrop and sweat to preserve it Please help me keep my house Sincerely

On XX XX 18 someone used my social security number DOB and potentially other information to get a PIN for my Capital One 360 online savings account where the person changed my password Luckily I noticed the password change notification and put a hold on my accounts Based on the information the Capital One security team provided to me the perpetrator was most likely my soon to be ex wife who has no legal right to that account or the funds in that account Capital One claims that they have two factor authentication in place to prevent this type of attack from occurring However the perpetrator was able to use their own phone number for the second factor a phone number that has never been registered with Capital One or associated with me in any way that I know about Upon further discussions with the Capital One security team I discovered that they will consult a 3rd party database to determine if a phone number is associated with an identity rather than the information provided by the customer So apparently the perpetrator has signed up for some other account or service somewhere using their phone number and my information This was enough for Capital One to use that phone number as the second factor of authentication Meaning the attacker can use the first factor information about me to generate the second factor a trusted phone number at will So they do not use two factor authentication as claimed There is no way to disable this 3rd party database check so I have no way to protect my accounts going forward It s already proven the person in question has all of my information which could happen in domestic cases like this data breach cases etc and that is sufficient to bypass all of Capital One s security which is what true 2 factor auth is intended to prevent Due to this my account and funds have been on hold since that time I have made repeated explanations to their security team how this is a major security hole as it effectively makes their two factor auth single factor auth The reps I have spoken with claim that their superiors don t see this as an issue and that I d probably get more traction if I had actually let the perpetrator steal funds from my account rather than preventing the theft So effectively Capital One is stating that they do not have the ability and or desire to protect its customers from fraud due to security holes in their system

on XX XX 2018 I applied for a personal loan at upgrade com after receiving a pre approval via mail I was approved for the loan based on my credit history and was told that the only thing I needed to do was to verify that the banking info I provided was indeed my account so that when the deposit for my loan was made it would go into the correct account once again at this point I already provided ID Bank statements Proof of income etc and was Approve for the loan A Rep called me back and once again stated I needed to log into my personal bank account via upgrade com site where I would receive my loan just to ensure that the routing and account number matched and belonged to me After doing so the rep advised me that the loan would be deposited in approximately 3 5 business days and my first payment will be due 30 days after the loan deposited the following day on XX XX 2018 a rep called and said he had a few questions about a transaction on my banking statement a month ago from XXXX shocked at this point because I was never told that me logging into my account to verify my routing and account number included them monitoring my transactions from a month ago Never the less I went ahead and explained that it was indeed a payday loan that doesnt report to the credit bureaus and it was resolved if it was really that important to know The rep Then challenged my answer by stating he was currently looking at XXXX and see that they offer lines of credit and that should report I then again explained that XXXX doesnot report anything to the credit bureaus and since he was online he could XXXX that to verify what i was telling him was correct or call them his self The rep then said he understood and would call me back Later on that day XX XX 18 at exactly XXXX XXXX for 41 miutes I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX who said she have to go back and declined my loan because of a transaction from my personal bank from an online web site XXXX that could possibly be a recent loan and I cant have a new loan less than 60 days because it could effect my credit score if it report later which would Later make me en eligible for the loan Now extremely frustrated but calm and pleading my case I explained that XXXX doesnt report to the credit bureaus and I got the loan in XXXX in which she indeed saw so if it was to report it would ve reported already I explained that she could contact them I could do a conference call I could even fax over documentation or she could look on the website Ms XXXX then stated she cant look on the website or do any of the above to verify she said it COULD be a payday loan and i COULD be telling the truth but she cant go off of the possibility this was very contradicting because the supervisors rep that i talked to earlier had already explained that both him and her was looking up the website to get info Fast forward I was denied the loan not due to my credit worthiness or my payment history but simply because my personal banking transaction that has NOTHING to do with the information they retrieved from my credit report at that time Especially if I was already approved I was never told that they would snoop through my banking info I was told the sole purpose of logging into my banking through their site was to confirm my routing and account number not dissect my transactions I feel as if this company has invaded my privacy as well as violated federal laws and discriminated against me based upon something that was not factual XXXX payday loan doesn t and will never report to my credit or anyone elses and legally a persons income That doesn t effect credit worthiness is considered an illegal way to deny a person and that being the ONLY reason As A result I have obtained an attorney and will file a civil lawsuit based upon invasion of privacy and discrimination denial based upon income that doesn t effect credit worthiness it is My legal right as a U S citizen to have equal opportunity with any financial company and upgrade com failed to show me that and this complaint is step 1 of my civil lawsuit

I was having a hard time managing multiple checking accounts while going through my XXXX treatments so I closed the one charging me monthly fees Bank of America Checking I closed this account from within my local branch the only way allowed and was told that it would be closed with a zero balance and all pending transactions including automatic payment to my credit card also with BoA were factored in I was given incorrect information by the branch and the payment to my credit card did not go through a tiny 20 00 or 40 00 amount Due to the bounceback from closing my checking BoA put a restriction on the credit card payment system and did not allow me to make any payments on the account I was not able to visit a local branch again due to being in the hospital for XXXX with my XXXX and they listed the account as past due and closed my credit card resulting in a 100 pt drop in my nearly perfect credit score In addition when I called to attempt to resolve the issue a call placed while at my local branch I was given a trove a misinformation which was also given to the branch manager They also ran my credit again without my permission when looking into re opening the closed account resulting in a hard inquiry that I did not place and further drop in my credit score Both of these issues have caused my credit score to drop

I am filing this dispute as non compliance with UDAAP I have been a long time client with multiple accounts both deposit and credit card accounts and feel this should be investigated and handled better Instead their lack of concern and knowledge to ensure their system which has a guarantee they list on their site accurately calculates the amount of time a check would require for mailing via USPS during non peak times which leads to their customers incurring fees is unfair and deceptive We trust their knowledge and their word so if they can not properly estimate the dates they should not be listed Additionally if they are not willing to adhere to the guarantee they themselves have published on their site which states they will reimburse their customer for any fees incurred they should not publish one especially given the guarantee is referencing the date which is calculated assigned by their system Now that I am trying to keep them to their word after having trusted them with my money they refuse to make it right and blame it on other parties I have attached proof of payment which notes 1 the dates which the payment was sent and expected to arrive 2 the copy of the submitted check 3 the payee system s stamp of receipt 2 days after the Deliver By date I assigned And lastly I attached screenshots of their site s guarantee for the Bill Pay service For the last 2 month s I scheduled my monthly payment for a store credit card via Chase s Pay Bills function The system notified me the payee is not set up for electronic payment and would require a paper check to be mailed therefore the funds would be drawn from my account several days before the due date to allow 5 business days for the check to arrive at the payee The system allows you to select the Deliver By date and will automatically populate the date for which it will pull the funds from my account I always set the Deliver By date for the business day prior to the statement s due date However the payee has noted both XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX payments arrived the day after the due date 2 days after the assigned Deliver By date causing my account to accrue late fees interest charges and other fees that would have otherwise been avoided had Chase adhered to their promise I trusted them and their system to ensure my payments I designated would arrive on time given you are able to assign a Deliver Date and the system calculates the Send On date Instead that trust in Chase and the Online Bill Pay they advertise and steered me to has led to me being required to pay additional monies for their failure to adhere to their Online Bill Pay Guarantee I have been charged late fees 3 00 charged in XXXX 4 00 charged in XXXX interest 1 00 charged in each month and other fees 0 00 charged in XXXX 0 00 charged in XXXX due to these 2 payments I scheduled through Chase s Pay Bills function arriving 2 days after the scheduled Deliver By date Therefore I am asking to be reimbursed for the these amounts I logged into my store credit card s site early this morning XX XX XXXX around XXXX XXXX to check whether I had used it for a large purchase the other day When reviewing the activity I noticed late fees interest were charged in both months I contacted Chase Customer Service and spoke with XXXX She placed me on hold for about 5 7 minutes to speak with a Sr Online Specialist and they determined there was no way for them to know if the check was held in processing and not mailed for a day or two They only have the date the check was cut and are relying on the systems to send out the checks on time Therefore they stated it must have been due to a delay at the USPS and suggested I simply send it days earlier but there was nothing they could do as far as reimbursing me for these fees I asked to speak with a supervisor at which time I was transferred to XXXX He advised he did not know of any Bill Pay guarantee like the one I kept referring to I advised it was on their site and he again denied any knowledge of it Instead he too suggested I send it even earlier and there was no way they could reimburse me or make me whole I advised I wasn t setting the Send On date I was only entering the Deliver By date and their system was calculating the Send On date He mentioned again it must have been a delay with the USPS however I asked is that not why we give it 5 days to arrive to the payee Given the system has both the address of Chase s check processing center and of the payee it should be able to calculate the amount of time it would require And a check mailed from Delaware to Texas takes approximately 3 days so had it been sent on time there is no way the check would not have arrived on time given the 2 day buffer

I have a credit card with XXXX XXXX provided by XXXX XXXX I ve had this card since XX XX 2017 and received several increases and had those increases then taking away because the bank is stating I should have never received them because they were done manually when the the bank constantly does this it takes a big hit on my credit score and it s very shameful to try and make a purchase and later find out during check out the funds have been taken away one minute my limit is XXXX the next XXXX and now XXXX I have always paid my credit card bill on time never late not once and the bank has even stated I have a excellent payment history with them This bank is horrible not only with constantly decreasing credit limits but also stating you have other accounts with them that you never opened in your name A couple months ago I contacted them about an account I noticed on my credit report called woman within and told them I never had an account with his company and the charges were not mine they still have not removed this item from my credit report I m at all wits end I Don t understand how this is considered acceptable Another thing that really bothers me is when they decrease the limit I call to bring it to there attention they then say if you agree to apply for an increase we can do an application to see if we can approve you The sad thing is when you choose to agree to that it lowers your credit score When in fact if they would just leave your limit where it is you wouldn t be calling in the first place I Have other credit cards and never have this problem with them going back and fourth on my limits

Please make this a rush as I have a sale scheduled for my property on Tuesday XX XX XXXX and Im under a loan modification review This is XXXX XXXX I have some very bad issues going on right now with my servicer SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and about my previous banks I m having a very hard time dealing and working with my servicer SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have mailed and faxed over all documents for a loan modification but they are still proceeding with the foreclosure sale scheduled for XX XX XXXX If they proceed with the sale they will be in violation of the CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS BILL OF RIGHTS and other laws as well As part of this bailout on XX XX XXXX the United States Government took over XXXX XXXX and pumped billions which in XX XX XXXX then Treasury Secretary XXXX XXXX said as much as 200 00 XXXX would be pumped into XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX each which was separate from the 700 00 in TARP funds given out to other lenders 1 The guidelines issued by the United States Treasury set forth a detailed process whereby a participating servicer either action or not acting through its subsidiary must a identify loans that are subject to modification under the HAMP program both through its own review and in response to requests for modification from individual homeowners b collect financial and other personal information from the homeowners to evaluate whether the homeowner is eligible for a loan modification under HAMP c institute a modified loan with a reduced payment amount as per a mandated formula that is effective for a three month trial period for borrowers that are eligible for a modification and d provide a permanently modified loan to those homeowners who comply with the requirements during the trial period Whether the homeowner qualifies for a modification or not participating servicers are also required to provide written notices to every mortgage borrower that has been evaluated for a loan modification whether or not the borrower has been found eligible HAMP and its associated directives also set prohibitions against certain conduct including demanding upfront payments in order to be evaluated for a loan modification instituting or continuing foreclosures while a borrower is being evaluated for a loan modification assigning a single point of contact maintaining an adequate level communication with borrowers maintaining proper caseload to ensure HAMP objections are met and restrictions on the way a servicer may report the borrower to credit reporting agencies All servicers have systematically failed to comply with the terms of the HAMP directives and has regularly and repeatedly violated several of its prohibitions Now that HAMP is over and expired due to servicers prolonging these modifications they are now proceeding with other alternatives Under HAMP the federal government incentivizes participating servicers to make adjustments to existing mortgage obligations in order to make the monthly payments more affordable Servicers receive at least 1000 00 for each HAMP modification However this incentive is countered by a number of financial factors that make it more profitable for a mortgage servicer avoid modification and to continue to keep a mortgage in a state of default or distress and to push loans toward foreclosure This is especially true in cases where the mortgage is owned by a third party investor and is merely serviced by the servicer However this incentive is countered by a number of financial factors that make it more profitable for a mortgage servicer such as SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to avoid modification and to continue to keep a mortgage in a state of default or distress and to push loans toward foreclosure This is especially true in cases where the mortgage is owned by a third party investor and is merely serviced by Service companies because Service companies do not carry a significant risk of loss in the event of foreclosure California Business and Professions Code 17200 et seq also known as the California Unfair Competition Law UCL prohibits acts of unfair competition including any unlawful unfair or deceptive business act or practice as well as unfair deceptive untrue or misleading advertising SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and all other previous servicers and their Investors conduct was unlawful in that They illegally began and prosecuted the non judicial foreclosure based on the lien to the 1st Deed of Trust despite i was not in breach of payments on said lien They engaged in the uniform practice of requesting unnecessary documentation seeking repetitive submissions of the same documents and never rendering a decision and in doing so such activity provides the basis for an unfair inquiry and could deceive the public because it places burdensome requirements on me that served no purpose but to provide a basis for either engaging in Dual Tracking by selling my home and by denying loss mitigation options such as loan modifications They failed to properly consider loan modification applications before trying to sell my home 1 On information and belief SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX does not own a significant majority of the loans on which it functions as servicer 2 Economic Factors that discourage SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from meeting its obligations under HAMP by facilitating loan modifications include the following a SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX may be required to repurchase loans from the investor in order to permanently modify the loan This presents a substantial cost and loss of revenue that can be avoided by keeping the loan in a state of temporary modification or lingering default b The monthly service fee that SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the servicer collects as to each loan it services in a pool of loans is calculated as a fixed percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans in the pool Consequently the modifying of a loan to reduce the principal balance results in a lower monthly fee to the servicer c Fees that SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX charges borrowers that are in default constitute a significant source of revenue to it Aside from income SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX directly receives late fees and process management fees are often added to the principal loan amount thereby increasing the unpaid balance in a pool of loans and increasing the amount of the servicers monthly service fee d Entering into a permanent modification will often delay a servicers ability to recover advances it is required to make to investors of the unpaid principal and interest payment of a non performing loan The servicers right to recover expenses from an investor in a loan modification rather than a foreclosure is often less clear and less generous e Fixed overhead costs involved in successfully performing loan modifications involve up front costs to the servicer for additional staffing physical infrastructure and expenses such as property valuation credit reports and financing costs 3 Rather than allocating adequate resources and working diligently to reduce the number of loans in danger of default by establishing permanent modifications SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has serially strung out delayed and otherwise hindered the modification processes that it contractually undertook to facilitate when it accepted billions of dollars from the United States SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX delay and obstruction tactics have taken various forms with the common result that my loan serviced by SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in which im eligible for permanent loan modifications and have met the requirements for participation in HAMP have not received permanent loan modifications to which iam entitled 4 By failing to comply with the California Homeowner Bill of Rights specifically by engaging in the unlawful practice of Dual Tracking SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has left me in a state of despair and panic as I seek a loan modification from SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING A DIVISION OF XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX only to have my home wrongfully oppressively and illegally sold out from under my feet When I opened my loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX my monthly payment was 1300 00 I couldnt pay them anymore due to my divorce my husband left me and left me in the waters I applied for a Loan Modification and they told me to make some trial period payments of 1500 00 I paid all three times for the three months on time After the payments were done they transferred me to XXXX XXXX

On XX XX 18 XXXX XXXX called one of my references and informed them i am behind in my payments and disclosed how much i owe them The reference they called was a family member that had no right to know how much i owed or inform them of what type of loan i had with them 
My mortgage company XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Freedom Morgage I was set to auto pay XXXX so every month they sent me a mortgage statement and I filed it away When they sold the loan I didn t have any knowledge that it had happened The first I knew about it was when Freedom Morgage sent me a foreclosure notice which I assumed was also junk mail but I looked at it anyway It turned out I was a few weeks behind on the payment and this was their way of letting me know welcome you are being foreclosed on even though it was literally just a few weeks late I started scrambling around trying to find info on this new lender and realized that they didn t transfer my auto payment so I needed to setup a new account with them to pay it I did that and then tried to setup an auto payment plan but they wouldn t let me do THAT because they needed my first payment to clear So a week later I went in and setup the autopay Selected the full amount payment on the due date and considered it taken care of About 2 months later they sent me another threatening letter saying my escrow payments were going to be short It turns out they had created an auto payment amount that wasn t for the correct amount I am going to assume this is because it makes me think they are charging me less but of course it was just wrong The letter said if I did nothing they would adjust my amount So I left it alone and am chalking that one up to standard deceptive marketing practices at worse and incompetence at best However they ALSO charged me a 15 00 drive by fee Apparently this is because my payment was late in XXXX so they say they charge this fee to make sure the house is ok I would bet the value of the house that no one drives by and this is just a random fee to get around the fact that they are not legally allowed to charge fees within a 60 day grace period during mortgage service purchase transfers This company is a general disgrace and this fee is wholly fraudulent 
I have banked with Chase bank since my accounts were with Washington Mutual and when I went to check the activity on these accounts on XX XX 18 I had to call in to get a restriction taken off I was informed that my accounts had been shut down and that Chase no longer wanted me as a client I have never been over drawn in any of my 3 accounts 1 checking 2 savings and never received a warning of any kind that there was an issue I also have 2 college savings accounts set up through Chase along with 3 credit cards with Visa that I now no longer have access to check activity to I was not given a reason for the cancellation and I am now very concerned that I may have had my identity stolen I have since closed those checking and savings accounts and opened new ones so I am not necessarily looking for reinstatement just some more information or at least why I was never given any notification about the closures I would also like to have online access to my credit card accounts reinstated 
Beside the fact that there was no notification given about this debt this debt collector is not licensed in the State of New York to collect debts The only license number provided from them is not registered as a licensee with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Department of Consumer Affairs 
I have 2 accounts with Bank of America One of the account use to be a saving account After being charge the fee because they changed the policy and said you need to have XXXX or more on your account to not have fee charged to take money out I was told to switch it to a checking account and I wish I didnt do that On the first account it has been open for 10 or more years the second maybe a year I have been charged fee on fee things going into my account that I called and said was not authorized and it wasnt me I was charge to pay my rent I also have looked in my account and seen that the bigger amount are saved and the smaller amounts that have already been taken out have fees charged to it I had a credit card with Bank of America and was charged for something they decided to refund back to my account Something needs to be done because I am tired of it
In early XX XX XXXX I returned a pair of new XXXX phone XXXX claimed I did not turn in the phones timely when I in fact did They later agreed and dropped the claim However later in XX XX XXXX I learned they sold the alleged unsresolved debt to a debt collector When I challenged the collector for documentation and they learned it was insufficient they dropped the claim In XX XX XXXX another collector reached out to me and I filed a complaint with the FCC attached That collector then dropped the claim Now in XX XX XXXX another collector comes to collect the alleged debt because XXXX has not pulled back their claim from the debt database The collection is showing on 2 of my credit bureaus and when I contested it the debt collector XXXX XXXX immediately confirmed it without verifying the underlying debt exists I am suffering credit consequences for the unlawful reporting of this alleged debt to the credit bureaus Furthermore XXXX XXXX posted the alleged debt as occurring in XX XX XXXX in their reporting which is also inaccurate Before going serving a lawsuit on XXXX and XXXX XXXX I am hoping to resolve the issue via the CFPB as soon as possible 
Chase permantely closed my checking and savings accounts and won t let me access my credit card accounts online They have not provided me with a reason 
I have tried to work with Ditech From XX XX 2018 we have submitted documents to Ditech we submitted requested documents Then on XX XX 2018 we received a letter stating that information was received and we had to wait 30 days for a response Then we were notified that the loan was transferred to another servicer We waited and then when we tried to communicate with the new servicer they had none of the information concerning our loan Again on a letter dated XXXX XXXX again we received a Notice of Sale of Ownership of Mortgage Loan but on XX XX 2018 Ditech accepted a mortgage payment in the amount of 2300 00 with a conformation number of XXXX We have a notice of Servicing Transfer dated XX XX 2018 to XXXX XXXX with no new loan number and they do not have the complete file from Ditech and we have a sale date for XX XX 2018 XXXX What happens to all of the documents that were submitted to Ditech in XXXX XXXX XX XX 2018 Why do we have a sale date when they accepted a mortgage payment from us Please help us with this impossible situation Thank You
On XX XX 2018 I opened up a XXXX XXXX XXXX card because the associate said I would get 25 off purchases made that day and the next day I was looking for a disclosure about the 25 because I thought it was 20 and the associate said they didnt have any updated ones so I never got one I just received my first statement in which the balance is 1000 00 my actual balance is 1100 00 because I purchased items online that night so the complaint is for the full amount of 1100 00 When looking at my purchases I did not receive the 25 off of everything like I was told I called customer service and they told me the 25 off was up to 100 00 I was never told this and would not have opened the card The customer service rep transferred me to a manager at the water tower XXXX in XXXX where I opened the card and she told me she was going to contact the manager of the associate and call me back but I still havent received a call back 
I sent 2 letters to XXXX XXXX which is a debt collector for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In the 2 letters I asked for verification of debt they say I owe to them Anything signed to prove I owe them what they say I do Any document supporting their claim I received 2 letters back with the words we have verified the debt with no supporting documents at all I have the right to dispute their claim since they put it on my credit report and is effecting my credit Nothing was sent to me That is not a verification of debt 
On XX XX 2018 I called the bank and submitted a stop payment request to cancel check number XXXX in the amount of 3500 00 from clearing through my account The call center representative told me the check had not been deposited yet and the stop payment request would go through However chrck nunber XXXX in the amount of 3500 00 was cleared through my account on XX XX 2018 I called the bank during the XXXX est hour in XXXX XXXX to resolve and get my money back into my account because the bank was notified to not cash the check The banks representivies from the claims department told me there was nothing they could do and I needed to contact the person who cashed the check My agreement to stop payment on the check was not through the payee but through my financial institution Due to a customer service representative incompetence to submit the right request I was not only charged a stop payment fee but the stop payment request was ineffective and now I am missing 3500 00 After multiple attempts via phone secure message emails and social media CHASE BANK has told me that they can not do anything to return my funds 
To whom it may concern There is a great deal of concern that must be shared regarding the way JP Morgan Chase is delaying point of sale debit transactions I have took notice that JP Morgan Chase delays debits and then pushes the debit s through purposely when there is no funds in the account or a negative balance will be caused to the account with the transaction When I contacted Chase at XXXX I was only offered criticism and how the overdraft was my fault because I signed an agreement allowing transactions to go through There is a big gap in what Chase is offering the everyday customer as an explanation in these agreements to what is actually happening when the customer is getting hit with overdraft fees There is an abuse of power on Chase part They could only blame the merchant But I swipe my debit card when I have money and the transaction is delayed three days Why is Chase running this scam and hiding behind these debit agreements I can testify that there is money in my account when I use it The debits are being purposely delayed and pushed through in bunches in an effort to collect 34 00 in bank fees for each debit I am a XXXX customer and I was met with criticism for Chase supervisors on XXXX at approximately XXXX PST via telephone for not managing my account the way a non XXXX person could It s frankly disgusting Please confirm at your earliest convenience the status of this complaint 
Amount they are claiming I owe XXXX 80 00 They have called my personal cell phone number from the number XXXX XXXX on the following dates and times XX XX 2018 at XXXX XX XX 2018 at XXXX XX XX 2018 at XXXX They also used the following number on XX XX 2018 at XXXX XXXX XXXX I have received multiple collections letters in the mail claiming to be coupons and other misleading things from this company On XX XX 2018 this company called my girlfriend on her personal cell phone number at XXXX from the number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX They also called her number on XX XX 2018 at XXXX from phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX When answered the calls are completely silent Upon calling them back it s revealed that its this collection agency This debt is originally owed to XXXX from a no contract phone service They keep reporting to my credit as a recent debt to keep collecting I ve checked my credit reports and their claim keeps getting updated as if I just acquired it 
This company has been reporting incorrect dates This account is past the statute of limitations 
XX XX 2018 Debt Collection Company from XXXX IL called me about a debt that is beyond the statute of limitations for the time that I can be contacted Their phone number is XXXX ARA is the name of the company XXXX XXXX XXXX is the name of the company Please do something about this NOW 
My mortgage was transferred to HomePoint Financial which identifies as a debt collection agency in XX XX 2018 I called them and was told that they would reconcile my last payment with my previous lender and there would be no issues for 90 days In XX XX XXXX I began receiving daily calls identifying a missed payment I have provided evidence of all my timely payments to them via email on XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX after lengthy calls with their representatives I have evidence that a monthly payment that was received and deposited and have provided evidence of checks that have cleared I have also provided a spreadsheet of my payments Their response to my evidence is to provide a listing of payments that match neither the actual amount paid nor the timing of the payment Please see the attachments below for detailed evidence HomePoint Financial has been terrible to work with You can never speak with the same representative no one can tell you if your issue is resolved and it is now three months of frustration They are asking for late fees when none are due I am worried about my credit 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is trying to collect on a debt but has added many charges to the amount and will not explain them or provide a ledger detailing the accounting In XX XX XXXX I signed a 12 month residential lease for about XXXX month In early XX XX XXXX I was forced to break my lease After I surrendered possession of the rental the landlord did not return my security deposit Thunderbird is not the landlord but a debt collector About XX XX XXXX it began to report to the credit bureaus that I owed approximate 12000 00 for the rental debt I contacted Thunderbird and asked why the debt was so high They stated that I owed the rent for the remainder of the lease approximately 6000 00 and the rest was collection fees and interest approximately 6000 00 My lease did not provide for fines and fees of this amount I do not understand why Thunderbird believes it can charge me such extreme and abusive amounts and not even explain itself My next door neighbor at that rental informed me that the landlord had a new renter in my old unit within a few months It is unfair that even though Thunderbird was getting paid rent for the time of my lease it is still trying to double collect the same rent money from me In the same way it is not fair that Thunderbird has added huge collection fees to my bill My lease agreement did not allow for such high fees nor did I agree to them at any other time Thunderbird can not have more rights to bill me than my landlord did I have made many requests for more information Thunderbird representatives told me that it was none of my business when asked for verification of the new renter who had moved into my old apartment Further I disputed this debt with the credit bureaus at least one time a month for nearly a year Each time Thunderbird has verified that the claim was valid but did not provide any documentation to support its claim Thunderbird s calls have been harassing to me and my family They call several times a week They leave messages that are intimidating They threatened to call my boss They even embarrassed me by calling my mom about the debt Thunderbird s actions have been very harmful to me My credit score has dropped significantly Because of my low score I have been unable to secure a loan to purchase a house and I am forced to rent I need to get a new car but the interest rates for the loan are prohibitive The stress from this issue has been hard on me I can t sleep at night it makes me anxious I dread answering my phone and I have been impatient with my family I genuinely don t know if I owe any money at all on this debt Thunderbird s deceptive practices have prevented me from reviewing any useful documentation I can not make an informed decision about this because they won t cooperate with me I ask that the CFPB force Thunderbird to provide me with a detailed accounting and explanation of the debt or in the alternative stop its collection attempts and credit reporting against me 
not my debt
They called again today XX XX 2018 Twice After they called more than 3 times yesterday Lied saying they were not a collection agency But when I called the number back the automated greeting was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX They were rude and harassing and I intend to look more into the legal laws about the calls 1 man I spoke to even suggested they had gotten people fired for their the way they were talked to and processed to threaten about finding the owners and contacting them 
Chase bank locked my accounts I can not log in or access any of my accounts This started because a friend of mine sent me money using Chase XXXX XXXX about 1200 00 My friend sent the money from her Chase account to mine and yet they locked my account because they could not verify her She is currently on XXXX leave in XXXX and will not be back to the US for months Chase told me they will not unlock my account until she comes to America to verify her account with them I asked how can you lock my account because of an issue with someone else s account They could not provide any reason or explanation to me This is a big problem for me since Chase has my checking account and money that pays for my bills and credit cards and I can not access any of my funds or accounts for two days now Chase also has control of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card 
I have made attempts to get Portfolio Recovery to remove off my credit report the credit card from XXXX XXXX I have asked them to remove it due to it being listed as collection past due charge off they have not listed it on my credit as being in dispute I have sent out letters to them certified The account says it is paid and closed but it then is listed on my report as 120 day late This is a violation of the FCRA it also has an inaccurate account number I have asked them to provide me with my signature and this has not happened I am asking that they remove this from my credit report or I will have no other choice but to take them to small claims court for the Inaccurate Incomplete and Unverifiable information 
My card was charged 38 00 by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX branch fraudulently and 53 bank did not redeposit that amount like their representative told me during our conversation Instead an additional and magical 1 00 appeared in my checking account the next day So I am assuming that its the bank that has done the fraud and not the store 
This complaint is in response to an existing unresolved complaint XXXX This complaint letter is in response to Wells Fargo s letter dated on XX XX XXXX for the claim above alleging additional information were requested in your letter dated on XX XX XXXX however no such request were provided in such letter In addition I called your department and spoke to XXXX in which he refused to give me his last name and refused to transfer the call to you and told me that a manager will call me but no one did and XXXX didnt mentioned to me that additional information was required from our part My phone number was included in my letter and never received a call from you either In addition as you mentioned in your letter 90 days were given to merchant to respond to our claim therefore the burden is on them and is not our responsibility if they fail to respond thus we demand this charges in the amount of 400 00 to be reverse into our account Also you mentioned in your letter that you were informed that we had done business with this vendor please provide proof for such claim We have been a valued business customer since 1996 and we never have been in this situation being forced to spend time resources and stress in order to handled 4 un authorized withdrawals under your surveillance in one month The bottom line is that we didnt receive any services from this merchant and merchant didt provide us with any services WellsFargo has failed to provided proof for such claim Our last issue is that WellsFargo has failed to address the fact that the un authorized withdrawal was done in a date prior to the date allow for withdrawal indicated in the merchant agreement therefore we ask for this charge be reversed into our account

Honda Financial Services called my house Number that called me XXXX Number I was told to call XXXX XXXX Someone by the name of XXXX called me and said to call him back as this is an urgent matter I researched the number and there were many sites saying that this was a scam that uses Honda financial services but has no affiliation with Honda at all I called Honda themselves and they said they have no numbers in there system with the numbers I listed I believe this is a company trying to scam people into collecting fake auto debt and I wanted them to be looked into 
This company Penn Credit Corp is calling me multiple times a day from multiple States with different phone numbers trying to collect a debt for XXXX XXXX who has been informed multiple times Police report FTC Report etc that the account is the result of ID Theft and is therefore XXXX XXXX is in violation of FTC Rule 605B 
I have been paying a 150 00 minimum payment for several months For XXXX s statement the min payment went up 3 00 to 160 00 for that statement period I was told by a bank rep that this was due to XXXX having 31 days in the billing cycle as opposed to the previous few months only having 30 So for XXXX s statement that was due on XX XX 2018 I sent in the 150 00 that I have been paying for a few months I did not realize the increase of the 3 00 because my wife receives the e statements via e mail from this bank and I recently took control of paying the bills in the house and she did not tell me of this 3 00 increase in the minimum payment for XXXX I made the 150 00 payment for XXXX that was received by the bank on XX XX 18 with a due date of XX XX 2018 I was assessed a 27 00 late fee for not paying the full minimum payment due and not because the payment was late I telephone the bank in XXXX when I noticed the late fee and explained the situation I was informed the late fee would be removed from my account However their was miscommunication between myself and the rep because I believed that 27 00 late fee would be removed from my total minimum payment for the following month however I was told later on that this is not the case and that late fee would only be removed from my total overall balance with the bank So with that in mind I paid the original minimum payment of 160 00 for XXXX s statement with the knowledge that I wouldn t be charged 27 00 late fee This was not the case as I was charged another late fee for XXXX statement because I did not pay the full minimum payment of 180 00 160 00 plus the 27 00 late fee for the prior month thinking that late fee was waived So with the current XXXX statement due XX XX 2018 I was assessed another late fee of 38 00 bring XXXX minimum payment to 220 00 I noticed this and contacted customer service on XX XX 2018 and described this whole situation I was told that the two late fees of 27 00 and 38 00 would be waived from my TOTAL ACCOUNT BALANCE but not from my current min payment due on XX XX XXXX of this year I asked to speak to a supervisor When I did I informed her of the situation and she confirmed the two late fees were waived but the 220 00 minimum payment due could not be lowered I asked for an explanation why the minimum payment could not be reduced because I agreed to these terms and conditions when I opened the credit card account initially I then attempted to make the point that a 3 00 mistake on my part initially 2 months prior has now ballooned into an increase of 60 00 that I would have to make on the current statement and how unethical and wrong this situation appears to be She informed me that their was nothing that could be done with regards to the amount minimum pay due because of the original terms and conditions and due to the fact that the minimum due has already been cycled I informed the supervisor that I believed this was unfair and I would seek remedy to this issue That is the final correspondence with the bank and where we stand at the present time 
I applied for a 0 interest card with Capital One to help with keeping my small business operational My application and balance transfer was completed in XX XX XXXX With the XX XX XXXX statement payment due in XX XX XXXX a portion of my balance was subjected to a higher purchase interest rate XXXX XXXX has not provide any information on their monthly statement that clearly identified when the promotional rate would increase from XXXX percent to the purchase rate 22 65 There was no information disclosure in the monthly statement that indicated that the promotional rate would expire on a given date I have used these 0 rates to help offset the costs of my small business and have experience with other card issuers who do provide detailed statements that clearly identify the promotional rate and end date This is common among other card companies and I can provide multiple examples where this is reported legally and ethically through other credit card companies Capital One does not provide this information I have been paying around 120 00 per month to them under their promotional rate When I received a statement from Capital One last month XX XX XXXX there was a portion of my balance subject to a purchase rate There was also a Interest Saver payment option identified which had no apparent explanation At that time I contacted the Capital One call center and spoke with a representative who was going to look into the rate and provide me with an explanation and correct the issue They also instructed me to review my account online and that the rates and period would be available there I never received a call back from Capital One and I reviewed my account online but there was no information pertaining to when my promotional period would end what the Interest Saver option was or when the standard purchase rate would be applied When I received my XX XX XXXX statement the interest rate of 22 65 was now applied to my entire statement amount Total interest for the period was calculated at 200 00 and my monthly payment is now 310 00 more than double typical monthly payment amount Again with no disclosure of any impending rate increase resulting from the promotional period ending Additionally no mention of a Interest Saver option Tonight I contacted Capital One and spoke with a supervisor They reviewed my prior request and informed me that they would not address my concern That I would have been notified in a small disclosure initially at time of making the initial balance transfer of the timing for the promotional period and that it would have been my responsibility to contact them to find out when that period would end I contacted them last month they did not provide that information nor did the online account through their website as they had advised should I would like to close my account and never deal with Capital One again and will pursue doing so for personal and business accounts however I am now facing hundreds of dollars in interest charges that will continue to increase as this goes on As a small business owner this is not something that I can absorb I would be happy to transfer my balance to another institution for a 0 promo offer or a reduced interest rate but prefer not to pay anything to a company that certainly has the resources but does not provide disclosure of the end date of promotional offers If I had even a month s notice I could have initiated a transfer to another account with a lower reasonable interest rate My credit score rating will demonstrate my integrity with paying creditors on time every month for what is due This is not a reasonable approach I would like to ask for you to intervene and request Capital One to refund my interest charges to date In the meantime I will transfer the remaining amount financed to another financial institution that will provide me with appropriate and reasonable notification to prepare me for the completion of my promotional rate and not attempt to mislead me with minimum payments versus Interest Saver Payments Thank you for your consideration

To whom it may concern First of all I would like to thank you in advance for processing my complaint However I am infuriated with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield behavior and asked you with all

no repercussion However it has been approximately 1 week ago since I filed a complaint with CFPB against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield for FCRA and CFPB violation Now this I found out that Hunter Warfield is behind the lawsuit against me from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I can not believe it one can only XXXXmagine how many other consumers whom rights are being infringe upon by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield and it appears that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield does not have any remorse I know people feel as though their consumer rights are not being protected by the law because I do XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield has been compelled to adhere to the rules and regulation in both the Federal Credit Reporting Act FCRA and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA

and why is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield able to continuously blow off consumers by responding to their legitimate complaints with their bogus and frivolous responses that do not have any merit untrue and hearsay The fact of the matter is that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hunter Warfield has violated my consumer rights according to both the Federal Credit Reporting Act FCRA and the Fair Debt

In the past my loan payments were being made through XXXX student loan services About two years ago I received notice that XXXX was being taken over by XXXX education services My loan payment is made quarterly and I ve been making faithful and on time payments for about a year online at XXXX s website That last time I was able to make a payment was in XX XX 2018 and I have the receipt of payment for that In XXXX I noticed that I had not received notice for payment for my XXXX loan in sometime and went to the website so see about the loan I received a message saying that the service that I requested could not be accessed at that time I assumed it was an issue with the website Here we are now in XXXX and I am receiving the same message I called the company XXXX and received absolutely no help Initially I called and was transferred to a 100 automated department that did not reconize my SSN for logging in I called back and was transferred to the loans department where someone proceeded to tell me that I do not nor have I ever had an account with XX XX XXXX services I have multiple student loans and I do not know which ones fell under XXXX services She suggested that maybe it was a Perkins Loan and transferred me to that department This was again a 100 automated department that did not recognize my SSN or birthdate for logging in I called back and was told there was no manager to speak with and the customer service departments that I have been previously transferred to was all that they had to offer In short my loans are in limbo and no information can be offered by the company previously in charge of them as to where to make a payment It frustrating because I don t want to default on a loan simply because a company has less than professional business practices If it has to come to it I will definitely get a lawyer and take this problem up legally because it is unfair to expect me to have to pay any outstanding charges being accrued at this time I ve looked online and have seen many comments and reviews similar to mine referencing their experience with XXXX It is my hope that something gets done about this and puts these crooks out of business 
Forty eighXXXX years ago my husband and I opened a savings and checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX Over the years I opened several more accounts at the bank and the bank has changed hands three times These accounts were my primary accounts and they grew substantially to include our household savings and checking our children s savings and college acoounts and a trust account With each change of banks I made sure that all of my accounts would be tied together so that I did not have to pay any fees and this was the case until recently We had as many as eight accounts at the bank and never had a problem Over the years I have spoken to bank representatives about my accounts and I was assured that all the accounts were linked so that our substantial balance would preclude any fees A while ago I received a letter from the current bank Santander notifying me that I would be charged 1 00 per month on my trust accounts because they were inactive I promptly went into the bank and spoke with the branch manager He reversed the charge and I was not charged that fee again When I retired in XXXX I had the time to closely scrutinize my bank statements I was very surprised to see that I was being chraged 30 00 a month on the trust accounts I had never received a letter informing me that this would be done Instead a blanket statement was printed on monthly statements Since I had always been told that my substantial balances at the bank would preclude any fees I did not think that this generic statement applied to me The trust accounts were only a few XXXX dollars below the minimum required for the fee to be waived on those accounts while the aggregate amount of all of my accounts was significantly higher than the minimum required balances I could have easily transferred that amount into the trust accounts if I had been notified of pending fees by the bank And for a while I was also charged a 3 00 monthly fee for a paper statement for the trust accounts Since I am well over 65 years of age this violated bank policy and was later recinded But I had to bring it to the bank s attention when they certainly had the information in their records Once I became aware of the charges I went to the bank and spoke with a representative He assured me that he would handle the situation At one point he told me that my accounts should have been grandfathered While he was doing this Santander continued to charge my account The branch manager did credit my account for those charges but she has a limit of 100 00 and these charges had gone on for 5 years So there is a significant amount that was not returned to my account The local bank representatives referred me to the district executive After speaking with her several times she told me that she would refund 500 00 as a courtesy because of my longstanding relationship with the bank When I once again told her that I had been assured by a number of bank employees that I would not be charged any fees because of my substantial bank balances she told me that none of the people with whom I had spoken were still with the bank so she was not going to honor what they had assured me about my accounts I was told by my branch representative that I needed to keep the accounts in question open so that the 500 00 would be deposited The bank continued to charge me the monthly fees which the local branch credited back to my account Finally after 2 months I closed the trust accounts I am presently in the process of moving all of my accounts out of Santander Bank This has been a major inconvenience for me The bank should refund the 30 00 monthly charge that has been deducted from my account since XXXX XXXX 
I logged on to citibank to make my XX XX XXXX payment When making my payment I noticed that my min payment was higher than my XXXX min payment This didn t make sense to me as my principal balance should be going down and my min payment should be less than I logged into my statement and was shocked to learn that my interest rate is at 7 When I applied for the promotion offer it was at 1 99 and this rate was do to expire in XXXX Please explain in writing and in writing only why my rate is higher than I was offered along with my min payment going up every month Thank you XXXX XXXX

On XX XX XXXX I contacted Capital One s Spark Business Checking department at XXXX I wanted to verify whether or not my old Spark Business Checking account was still valid and available for use I was able to log into the account using my old credentials and saw there was a negative balance of 280 00 I had since XXXX The representative I spoke with that day advised me the account was still open and available for use She offered me an option to order a new debit card but I thought I had my old one so I declined I updated my phone number email and address from XXXX to XXXX online as well After confirming the account was in good standing I provided my employer with the account and routing number for my direct deposit On XX XX XXXX I couldn t find my old debit card and contacted Capital One s Spark Business Checking department at XXXX to request another card be sent to me The young lady politely confirmed my new address in XXXX sent me a new card and advised me the new card would arrive in 3 5 business days When I did not have the new card by XX XX XXXX I called Capital One s Spark Business Checking department at XXXX a third time to see if they were able to activate my old debit card The young lady politely reactivated my old debit card and changed the PIN number for me This was very important because I was scheduled to move into my new apartment onXX XX XXXX after sleeping in my car for 2 months On XX XX XXXX I called Capital One s Spark Business Checking department at XXXX to verify my old card was indeed active and was advised I would need to speak with another department to verify information before any incoming deposits Upon speaking with the department I was advised this was the collections department I was advised my direct deposit would go into the account but that after Capital One was paid their debt I would be sent a check in 2 5 business days with the balance I completely understand the company wanting to collect their debt I fully intended on paying it However I should not have spoken with 3 representatives before being briefed on the true status of the account The account was by all appearances open but per the collections department it was actually charged off All I am saying is that I feel the company deceived me into believing I had an active account when in fact the account was not active at all It was unfair of them to give me the idea that my account was available for use when in fact they were just attempting to collect a debt The ordeal has caused a great deal of emotional distress Yes I will get the funds eventually but I am hoping they still hold my apartment and I also hope my next direct deposit does not try to go into that account

I have a POA Power Of Attorney to act on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX the father whose daughter XXXX XXXX was a student who passed away in 2015 The father was the co signer and has continued making payments since his daughter s death Since last year I have been in continued contact with AES American Education Services the current student loan processor seeking loan forgiveness Except for this loan all of the student s other private student loans were forgiven due to death In XXXX of last year I d located and contacted the original lender XXXX XXXX I was told that XXXX s policy is to forgive student loans when the student borrower passes away Unfortunately XXXX had sold the loan and had no record of whom it had been sold to XXXX had no record of when the loan was sold ie before or after the date of the student s death XXXX told me that they had changed computer systems and loan processors and dated records no longer exist I was directed to their current loan processor AES with whom I had already initiated contact It took most of last year to locate the loan with AES to get them to agree that the loan should be forgiven and to get them to request loan forgiveness It also took most of the year before AES would divulge to me that XXXX owns the loan Since last year I have made THREE formal requests via AES to have the loan forgiven due to death Each time AES has sent a letter to XXXX making a formal request for loan forgiveness XXXX has not responded to any of the requests that AES has made The student was the father s only child thus the loss was and continues to be extremely traumatic Every time that he made a payment he relived the loss of his only child and grieves I ve explained this to AES countless times In fact the grief was so great that the father against my advice PREPAID a significant portion of the loan just to avoid the pain at payment time Based on research that I ve done I believe that XXXX has lost all records ownership paperwork for this student loan XXXX s failure to maintain or locate the loan record should NOT prevent them from forgiving the loan I ve attached a copy of an AES letter to me This letter contains copies of AES letters sent to the father confirming the last two formal requests that I d made to AES for loan forgiveness from XXXX These documents have all of the relevant information needed to identify the loan

I have been not been employed full time since XX XX XXXX and have been struggling with my auto loan payments and fell behind I was fortunate enough to find full time employment in XXXX and have been able to catch up payments and am now current in the month of XXXX I have been reviewing my past statements and saw several instances where when I am able to make payments I was still assessed a late fee The payment due date is the XXXX of each month with a grace period up until the XXXX of the same month I was in arrears by at least a month each month I made a payment until XX XX XXXX The details of the months where I was assessed a late fee despite my paying on time for that month are as follows 1 In XX XX XXXX I made my monthly payment on the XXXX yet was assessed a late fee on the XXXX 2 In XX XX XXXX I made my monthly payment on the XXXX yet was assessed a late fee on the XXXX 3 In XX XX XXXX I made two payments XXXX and the XXXX yet was assessed a late fee on the XXXX 4 In XX XX XXXX I made a payment on the XXXX yet was assessed a late fee on the XXXX 5 In XX XX XXXX I made a payment on the XXXX and made another payment on the XXXX to finally get caught up and yet was assessed a late fee on the XXXX I called Bank of America and asked why I was being assessed a late fee in the above months despite making my payments within the grace period I was told that because I was in arrears my payment were applied to the month s I was in arrears which still makes my current month payment late and was assessed a late fee This in effect charges me a late fee on top of a late fee since despite the month s payment was made on time the application of the payment received to my past due from prior month s makes my current month payment negligible

A few months ago my credit score was above 700 Today after paying all my bills on time my credit score is XXXX The reason is because Capital One continues to negligently accept fraudulent charges related to identity theft on my now closed accounts without notifying me I recently filed a complaint about this exact same issue and while awaiting a response I discovered by looking at my credit report that Capital One struck again and negligently accepted another fraudulent charge on my former credit card without notifying me Capital One then once again reported additional false derogatory information about me to the credit bureaus In other words Capital One is a serial abuser of their customer s credit ratings they apparently have no decent security apparatus and there appears to be no end in sight to their shenanigans Capital One knows or should know by now that the derogatory information they continue to disseminate against me is false Capital One just like any other company is required to report only correct and accurate information to the credit bureaus yet Capital One continues to brazenly flout the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Capital One regularly advertises zero fraud liability How much longer do you think that I should be liable for Capital One s facilitation and embrace of identity theft The next correspondence you receive from me will not be nearly as friendly as this one Capital One I m looking at legal options You need to stop lying to the credit bureaus about me today P S How would you feel if your credit score went down 100 points just because somebody you have no business with and haven t had any business with for several years would not stop disseminating derogatory information about you which they know to be false What would you do Would you sue them 
I was suffering from financial hardship and was seeking assistance and then hurricane irma hit and we were in a FEMA declared disaster zone I understood that Bank of America would be providing disaster loan modifications for those impacted I was on the disaster forbearance but they did not do the disaster modification as I was told I had to apply for standard assistance I did and there was some mix up until finally on XX XX 18 after finding out they had not reviewed me even though I sent in an updated application on XX XX 18 I spoke to a very helpful supervisor XXXX XXXX who took the time to look at my file and found out what the problem was I had to resubmit with the correct address information so I did and was encouraged as I would finally be getting help As a XXXX military veteran I also was seeking SCRA protection from the upcoming XX XX 18 foreclosure sale date and have not received it to this day Everything seemed to be going well and I was able to have a complete assistance package and was submitted to the underwriter and on XX XX 18 was told they were postponing the sale as Bank of America does not practice dual tracking then a borrower has a complete package as they have always done they post pone the sale date to allow time to review Days went by and still the sale had not been postponed On XX XX 18 after 2 other escalations my customer relations manager submitted another post ponement I was told an assured by many representatives that once I had a complete package the sale would be placed on hold I had no reason to doubt because that was the practice ever since the DOJ mortgage settlement restricting dual tracking I am submitting this complaint as Bank of America has defaulted on their commitment made by it s own representatives 
My problems with my mortgage lender has been ongoing for several years It started when XXXX XXXX misled me at origination and coerced me into a negative amortization loan and then continued through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and now Carrington I feel that I am not getting a fair shake and not getting access to the federal state and internal homeowner assistance programs that exist for people in my situation As a result of this predatory loan and my business being crushed by the recession as well as hurricane damage I am way behind on my mortgage I have tried many times to get reviewed for homeowner assistance programs but get conflicting information from my mortgage company and indifference Carrington took over the loan a couple of months ago and it seems to be more of the same I have had a good job for several years now and have recovered financially This is a situation that could be resolved if Carrington were to fairly negotiate with me I have been in my home for 25 years and don t want to lose it but feel it slipping away because the lender will not even give me a chance In XX XX XXXX I had to deal with a major fire that damaged my home and slowly rebuilt everything with the help of a construction loan In XX XX XXXX the agents from XXXX XXXX predatory subprime lender who went out of business convinced me that as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that a pick a pay loan was the way to go I had no idea how this loan worked nor the fact of how quickly and high the rate and payment could adjust as well as the actual balance increasing due to the negative amortization feature Like many Americans the recession hit me hard and my XXXX business struggled and eventually had to shut down I was able to keep up with my financial obligations for the next couple of years because of my savings but once that was gone I was in a tough situation I applied for help with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who now held my loan and they did offer me a modification however the monthly payment was not even close to affordable based on my income at the time so this did me no good My loan was then transferred to XXXX and I spent the better part of the next year chasing documents with them and never got anywhere The loan was then transferred to XXXX XXXX By this time I was gainfully employed as a XXXX at an event planning company and was in a position to afford a fair payment I applied for help through XXXX XXXX but it was an abyss transferred from department to department the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing etc Eventually I got into review and they told me that my application was denied because XXXX XXXX claimed they had made me a modification offer a few months prior and that I did not accept it so I was told that was the reason for the denial How can I accept an offer I don t even know about It makes no sense I did everything I could to try and get XXXX to reconsider and work with me based on the current financial situation but could not make any headway The situation was made worse by damage to the property and especially the roof from the hurricane XXXX XXXX was trying to claim some hugely inflated value without taking into consideration the damage I am sitting here with a good job and the means to make a fair mortgage payment XXXX and XXXX were both terrible partners to work with and despite my best efforts I still have no resolution Based on my initial contact with Carrington it seems they are just as bad as these companies if not worse I know that I am entitled to be reviewed and considered for federal state and internal modification programs and I need them to work with me All I want is an affordable modification so I can resolve this matter and pay on my debt The situation is exacerbated by the predatory nature of the toxic loan that I am in 
I have been making payments through the entire deferment stage On XX XX 2017 I called American Education Sercive AES to share that I made a payment on a deferred loan on XX XX XXXX My deferment ends in XX XX XXXX I asked How was the payment used that I have a loan payment due and an interest rate payment due in XX XX XXXX See attachments XXXX employee number XXXX shared that the payment was not used to pay the interest rate that is due but placed on the unsubsidized accounts I asked if there was an online format to pay the interest to prevent the addition to the principle and was told no When asked if there was a way to have the payment applied I was told to send a letter I asked if I should send a payment with the letter and it was repeated to send just a letter The pleasant tone diminished when asked why a format does not exist online to pay the interest to prevent having an additional amount accrued to the principle and should I not send a payment with the letter I was then told yes send the document that says that this is not a bill and to add a letter to ask that the amount sent in the mail should be applied to the interest This mode of payment is not transparent when looking through the website I was then asked if there was anything further that I needed and when responding no the conversation ended The site has a makeover but no format to prevent the interest from being added to the principal when the loan comes out of deferment I am working to pay off the loan and have the only option of the snail mail version without feedback I do not see where I would receive notification that this payment was made unless I check my checking account for the canceled check and to double check the accounts to make sure that the balance does not have an increase There should be a more effective way for this portion of payment when returning from a deferment

To Whom It May Concern I have had correspondence with Wells Fargo over several letters and phone calls regarding account and the illegality of the foreclosure that occurred in XXXX Again this foreclosure was preventable but Wells Fargo did everything in their power to make it unavoidable The latest correspondence from Wells Fargo indicates that they offered a viable solution for us to stay in our home but this is simply not true The only modification we were offered on our home mortgage was for a temporary modification of XXXX mo reduction of our mortgage This was not a sustainable option and was only temporary When we called Wells Fargo originally to discuss modification options we were told we should not pay any amount of our mortgage in order to qualify for the HAMP modification We were told to send many different sets of paperwork to Wells Fargo via fax We sent all this paperwork in several times over and told almost every time that the paperwork was not received or was lost Departments did not communicate with each other so one person would not know what the last person had said or seen from us We even sent things via mail because we were told so many times the faxes were not received or lost We were told that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage could not communicate with Wells Fargo Home Equity so a combined decision on a loan modification was impossible Most recently in the last letter received Wells Fargo Home Mortgage indicated that the home equity loan was written off in XXXX Unfortunately we were not informed of this and continued to receive bills by mail for this loan If we had known we could have only paid the home mortgage loan we could have afforded to stay in our home Additionally we qualified for a HAMP loan modification but recently were told by Wells Fargo that they did not receive the required paperwork for this modification We did send any and all paperwork we were asked to fill out and send because we were eager to stay in our home We are so dismayed at the deceitful actions taken by Wells Fargo and have experienced a windfall of negative consequences due to this foreclosure that was preventable but was forced upon us by Wells Fargos inability or their unwillingness to help our family stay in the home Wells Fargo refuses to admit negligence in this matter and continues to ask us to provide evidence Wells Fargo has evidence in their recorded calls and correspondence with us regarding the way they handled the matter Faxes were lost we were not informed in a timely manner they did not want to help us stay in our home because we were paying Private Mortgage Insurance which protected them from consequences of foreclosure yet did not protect us as the homeowners 
Saturday XX XX XXXX I received a CP2000 form from the IRS It stated that I had 2 disbursements that I did not account for on my XX XX XXXX Taxes Upon inspection there where two that pointed to JP Morgan Chase Bank on a retirement account CD that were distributed to me The account information states that it showed my Social Security Number SSN and gave the details of it being from a Chase Bank Retirement CD I called the Chase Bank 24 hour phone number and asked them to look up my SSN to see if I had any accounts on file with Chase as I have never used Chase Bank for anything They stated no they had no accounts for me and told me to go into a local branch bank on Monday to get more information I also called the IRS to ask them more about this item They told me to get a letter from the bank on Chase s letterhead stating that I had no accounts with them and the IRS then would investigate and remove this said money due After waiting for three 3 days to hear back from Chase because the branch manager wasn t available for whatever reason I finally was told that because I have no account on file they can not draft any letters on my behalf and had very little concern for my issue I then went home and called the IRS again They have since with my permission sent a payor letter to JP Morgan Chase to request them provide proof that that debt is mine I was told that I have to give it 30 60 days for the letter to be mailed by IRS received by JP Morgan Chase and then responded to by JP Morgan Chase Since the Chase Bank helpline and the branch bank both show no record of me having an account I expect this issue to be resolved But if they come back and refuse to remove this debt from me I was told that I might need to seek other means to resolve this After talking to the IRS they stated they only go to the taxpayer for this when the financial institution reports this income to IRS The fact that Chase Bank showed little concern for my problem and refused to assist when this is clearly their error is something that I am bringing to your attention and ask if you will please investigate this matter and help me and others not fall victim to this kind of treatment and mistake by JPMorgan Chase

This has been going on with the Wells Fargo since late XX XX XXXX early XX XX 2018 The only thing that the company has addresses in full was why they used that specific appraiser I am ok with their answer to that point only They still have not addressed the mistakes and wrong information for the properties that are in the appraisal at all and in specific detail By law Wells Fargo must have at least three accurate properties with correct facts in order to accept the appraisal which the full appraisal does not and only has one If Wells Fargo does not fix the errors and incorrect information and data in the report and or use the report and accept it then they are breaking the lending laws both federal state and local Wells Fargo must either correct the report or not accept it in order to follow all the laws and regulation that govern leading Wells Fargo still have not addresses the lies that the company employees have done i e said that they review information but did not and stated those facts on recorded calls What specific steps did Wells Fargo do to re train these employees and what improvements plans where these of these employees put on It is against the banking laws to lie to a customer through the lending process These happens during multiple stages through this application and have been documents on recorded calls To resolve this matter Wells Fargo must go back and listen to every single call in full and confirm to me that they did that in writing and they then took appropriate action against the employees that lied They had a legal team review this please explain in detail why Wells Fargo had a legal team need to review this if Wells Fargo did not do anything wrong

I was looking to apply for an everyday rewards credit card and I went online to www americanexpress com XX XX 2018 and clicked on cards There were different options for cards and the BLUE CASH EVERYDAY card seemed to fit my needs and what I was looking for The welcome offer stated 0 APR for the first 12 months 200 00 back as statement credit after spending 1000 00 using Amex card the first 3 months of card membership I then clicked apply now and upon submitting my information I was instantly approved I DID NOT leave the page and returned at a later time At the bottom of the welcome offer I clicked apply now After receiving my card I made a big purchase and I called american express to ask general questions on rewards and such I was told that I did not receive the welcome offer 0 APR I asked to speak with a manager and I was told they would investigate this and I would get a notification with the outcome of the investigation I was notified a few days later that I was not eligible for the welcome offer with no explanation I called back to speak with a manager and apparently a manager was not available and the representative took my phone number and told me I would receive a call from a supervisor manager No one ever called me I am extremely disappointed because I was looking to build my credit however due to the misleading and FALSE information advertising on the American Express website I am now receiving outstanding interest rates I would of never applied for this card if it wasn t for the welcome offer It is unfortunate that no one at American Express helped me by honoring the welcome offer and fixing the situation as I truly believe this is something that could of been rectified to keep customers happy Each and every representative I spoke to did not try to help me and seemed to rush me off the phone If they honored the welcome offer I would of been a loyal customer for life paid off my balance in full and continued to use my card and eventually upgrade I want American Express to do the right thing by applying the welcome offer to my account 0 APR and apply the 200 00 statement credit on the XXXX month since I spent over 1000 00 during the first 3 months of my card membership

Around XX XX 2017 my car was repossessed for non payment I was not notified of what would happen after the repossession as far as if my car was sold to an auction if i had a remaining balance but they were so eager to call me ten times a day harassing me for payment I am sure that there is a law in Florida for this My car was repossessed twice by these people Santander XXXX I told them that I was having financial hardship Customer service XXXX They are reporting two different amounts due which I will be showing proof of It is making my credit score look terrible and this needs to be resolved 
The complaint is against both attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX and para legal XXXX XXXX XXXX for negligence and mishandling representation and mediation between myself and my mortgage lender Mr Cooper Nationstar Mortgage NSM Both NSM and XXXX are attempting to sabotage my case and forcing my case past the statute of limitations Due to my loan status of litigation NSM refuses to discuss nor consider my attempts at bringing my account current XXXX has only been recently been assigned to mitigate my loan after the first set of attorneys were replaced My situation started back in XX XX XXXX when I was forced to file a lawsuit due to NSM failing to make timely disbursements of my hazard insurance which resulted in cancelation of a low premium for hazard insurance This is a direct violation to paragraph 3500 17 i 2 of RESPA k Timely payments 1 If the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow account the servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner that is on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty as long as the borrower s payment is not more than 30 days overdue 2 The servicer must advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner as long as the borrower s payment is not more than 30 days overdue Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to paragraph f of this section As a result my new policy was twice as much forcing my loan into delinquency because I could not afford the new escrow amounts from the replacement hazard policy Once my lawsuit was filed it was assigned to the previous lead counsel XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had been engaged in settlement negotiations as well as and modification efforts since mid XX XX XXXX when my civil case was first filed In fact XXXX XXXX has negatively impacted my dealings with my lender representing agent of Nationstar Mr Cooper NSM since day one NSM made the mistake of having XXXX XXXX manage not only the litigation matter but also loss mitigation efforts as well The loss mitigation process required for her to be a go between and to adhere to processing my loan modification with NSM as well as attempt to coerce me into dismissal of my lawsuit for various reasons I refused Then XXXX intentionally stalled the negotiations for 10 months due to her involvement At one point Ms XXXX received 4 separate transmissions of my complete loan modification request and supporting documents and basically for lack of a better words she refused to forward them to NSM for review In fact at one point she attempted to extort me by offering to review my loan for modification assistance in exchange for me dismissing my civil case with prejudice as well as she offered me a meager cash settlement of 500 00 I refused again to dismiss my case and was forced to file a CFPB complaint against her and NSM which in turn forced them to review my loan for assistance Mind you I have an FHA loan which requires specific guidelines to be followed when a review for modification assistance has been warranted XXXX XXXX attempted to circumvent these rules once I filed a consumer complaint with the Consumer Financial Bureau CFPB case XXXX and XXXX was called out and forced to comply with the review under FHA rules I feel that these actions were her way of attempting to bring this matter to a quick close I had to go as far as threaten her with amending my lawsuit with these additional claims for abusive extortion tactics in order to somewhat get her to cooperate Her resistance has only aggravated this matter rather than mediate Its also a fact that NSM attempted to sell my home while XXXX was in possession of multiple full packages for loan medication review which is considered dual tracking I was forced to file bankruptcy to stop the sale date attempts during the modification review process in the spring of XX XX XXXX Webb had been a virus in my attempts to protect the interests in the home and my rights as a homeowner for what NSM has done Again NSM has single handedly forced my loan into delinquency as a result of mishandling my escrow account shortly after taking over the loan then NSM took over my loan and has not been current since Fast forwarding my loan was finally approved for loan modification assistance on XX XX XXXX payments due in the amount of 1400 00 due XX XX XXXX thru XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX through XX XX XXXX Hurricane Harvey hit Texas most of our State was declared National Disaster within the first few days FHA immediately suspended all payments for Texas homeowners for up to 6 months or more if needed until the state of emergency could be thoroughly accessed Virtually everyone in Texas was affected by the storm in one form or another Rather than XXXX adhering to FHAs decisions of mortgage forbearance of payments as my loans investor She decided to have me make payments starting in XX XX XXXX rather than XX XX XXXX Then she contacted me again stating that the payment wouldnt be due until XX XX XXXX Payment was made and somehow derailed because there was an issue with my bank account and I received no notice whatsoever about a retuned payment I feel That XXXX was definitely leaving something out and hiding the fact that payments were not being demanded by FHA at all However by the time that I had been made aware the modification agreement had dismantled and I was contacted after the fact by XXXX I advised her that I had the ability to make up the payment or make 2 at once I informed her that I would have made up the payment or payments if only informed in ample enough time However do to the fact that my loan is flagged as litigation in the system for NSM No agents can call me at all for anything and all communications are relied upon by XXXX and XXXX XXXX She then was supposed to address this issue and determine when and where I could resume my payments to complete the trial plan I never heard back from her and the last time that we had any communications was XX XX XXXX Our last set of negotiations were dated XX XX XXXX in which attorney XXXX had presented to me via email per rule 408 a settlement of an amount that was considerably lower than what I had originally suggested in earlier in XX XX XXXX The last communications that I received from XXXX are as follows XX XX XXXX To date Ive received no notices via process service from XXXX XXXX which would indicate compliance with the Docket Control Order milestones Expert Witness Designation which was due XX XX XXXX nor has any firm representing NSM completed nor initiated Status Conference due by XX XX XXXX The discovery period endedXX XX XXXX and none of these proceedings steps have been adhered to There has been long blocks of time that has passed between communications with XXXX and I feel their involvement has negatively compromised my complaint It appears that the new law group assigned to my loan by NSM is also failing to adhere any of the civil lawsuit milestones At this point I feel it necessary to file an amendment to my original complaint in order to address the incompetency negligence misrepresentation and fraud of NSM and XXXX and also XXXX which the most recent counsel assigned to bring this matter to a close 
I purchased an item on XXXX that arrived DOA or dead on arrival it was simply defective didn t work I filed a claim through XXXX But because of misinformation I was given I closed the claim thinking I could reopen it on a later date However when I contacted XXXX to reinstate my claim I was informed that the system would not allow it as I had been led to believe by one of their representatives XXXX apologized and told me that I was still able to proceed with a claim through my bank As instructed on XX XX 2018 I filed a claim Num XXXX regarding the mentioned transaction with my bank However I found out today that in XXXX my bank had sent me a letter informing me that my claim had been closed The bank closed the claim founded on the fact that I had not provided proof that I returned the merchandise Nonetheless since the day I filed my claim I informed the bank that under the circumstances and according to strict and completely clear XXXX policy the seller was obligated to send me a prepaid shipping label if he wanted the merchandised returned I explained to my bank that it could not interfere with my sales contract I stressed that I had taken all the possible measures to inform the merchant of his obligation to supply the mentioned label and he chose not to fulfill said obligation I also stressed to the bank that any interference or changes insisted upon concerning the terms and conditions of the sale was unlawful Specifically I explained to the bank that they are a third party to my transaction and that obligating me to cover the cost of the return shipping and therefore relieving the seller of his responsibility constitutes an infringement of the contract which the seller and I voluntarily entered with regards to the sales terms and conditions governing transactions entered through XXXX In sum the bank s pressure to force me to act contrary to my contract is an extra limitation on their part They are not a party in this transaction period The bank just served to facilitate a payment Now under the circumstances described I am instructing the bank to reverse the payment As I have said the bank is unlawfully interfering in my transaction insisting on adding further terms to the sales contract in order to fulfill their obligation

I opened an Ultamate Rewards Mastercard in late XX XX 2017 at a store and was told I would be mailed the information required for paying the bill After two months I had still not received any bills or the physical card and was receiving robo calls demanding payment I explained to a customer service representative that I did not have the information to pay the bill and they kindly allowed me to immediately pay the bill over the phone and forgave my late fee They stated that they would send out another physical card and bill By XXXX I had still not received my card so I went to the store and they said they could just look it up using my phone number and other information I bought my products and they said they were sure another card was on the way In XXXX I had still not received a card I was now receiving robo calls again but I couldn t seem to catch a real representative on the phone to pay again Since I was working 4 jobs and finishing my thesis it took me a couple weeks to schedule a time that I could physically go into an XXXX store and ask them to give me my card information so I could use that to go online and pay a bill When I finally acquired this information I paid precisely off what I had spent but I asked that the company remove my late fee as I had not had access to pay the bill until I went beyond what should be deemed reasonable to do so due to never receiving my card They refused immediately and in frustration I closed my account I had double checked that my address was correct and I have never missed payments on any of my credit cards in my adult life Now they are all accumulating with late fees I have nearly 70 00 in fees that are the result of their mistake When I called again they said they couldn t adjust anything because my account was closed

On XX XX 2018 my husband and I woke up to an e mail from Citizens bank stating that we have reached our limited transfers for the month We knew something was wrong right away because neither of us had made any transfers from our checkings account to our savings account As soon as we logged on to online banking we saw that someone had gotten into our savings account and there were over 15 deposits and withdrawals all less than 1 00 from other banks and online websites trying to verify the account We printed the e mail along with our statements and went straight to the branch Overall it was discovered that we lost 0 00 Even though it was such a little amount a claim for fraud had to be filed and the account had to be left open until the claim was resolved In the meantime we opened a new savings account with Citizens withdrew 6100 00 from our original savings account and deposited it into the new one For the next three days it showed that we had 0 00 in the old account waiting for the claim to be resolved XXXX and 6100 00 in our new account On the morning of Tuesday XX XX XXXX my husband woke up to an e mail that a third person was added to our XXXX account Neither one of us had heard of the XXXX program but when we logged onto online banking there indeed was a third name listed on our accounts It was a name neither one of us had ever heard This person attempted to transfer 2500 00 out of our original savings account and made various credit card payments in amounts of 200 00 and 840 00 to other banks The bank approved all of these transactions however we were luckily able to cancel one of them while it was still pending The more suspicious activity we found on XX XX XXXX was that the NEW savings account which was only opened 4 days prior had also been hacked into and again we saw small charges from other banks trying to verify the account At the same time we still had the 6100 00 in our new savings account but 5900 00 was also showing in our old account that we had withdrew funds from It was our understanding that there was an ALL HOLDS on this account but were told that bank errors were made and would be resolved Out of 24 hours I spent 6 of them at the branch 5 months pregnant trying to resolve this issue which continued on Wednesday XX XX XXXX when Citizens Bank did a debit memo of 220 00 from our checking account which had not been hacked previously We learned that because we withdrew 6100 00 from Citizens on Saturday and 5900 00 displayed in our account four days later citizens took our money from a separate checking account to make adjustments without our permission At this point my husband and I agreed that my body and XXXX should not handle the stress and told the branch that we would be calling our lawyer On Wednesday XX XX XXXX this situation was escalated to the Office of the XXXX at Citizens bank The branch told us that we would hear from them in 2 3 business days Today XX XX XXXX makes two weeks since this case was escalated and we have not heard from anyone We have called their service center multiple times only to talk to multiple departments and hear the same answers someone will contact us At this point we still have not received our money back from the bank nor do we have any answers as to how these transactions were approved and how someone else was able to access our accounts We do have a very organized folder containing deposit withdrawal slips statements and letters of correspondence to and from the bank However until this goes further I am not comfortable uploading these documents at this time

Quicken loans changed their loan conditions for no GOOD reason or one we could find out after 4 years saying that the employee that set up our loan made a mistake and we were supposed to be paying hurricane insurance which quadruples the cost of our overall insurance and makes the house NO LONGER AFFORDABLE to live in and now we have to sell It is not right for them to change an agreement because someone screwed up because we based our decision to buy this home BASED ON THE AGREEMENT AND LOAN CONDITIONS THEY SPECIFIED at the time b c what they offered made this an affordable purchase We were told repeatedly which WAS WRONG and we PROVED it to them via our state insurance agent that the hurricane insurance was required by state law a total lie and proves their incompetence We accepted this lie for a year and had to pay the increased insurance and then we got hit with a huge escrow bill that we have to pay So we protested again this year XX XX 2018 when we got the nearly 1700 00 bill and after we proved to them that it is NOT state law to require this insurance we were then told that the investors require it but was NEVER answered about WHY what basis are the investors using for this decision because if they are using the state law justification it is not right or fair to do this to us We have repeatedly asked them to honor their original agreement with us as they are a multi million dollar company and a couple thousand dollars isn t going to hurt them but it is hurting us to the point where we have to sell and move They refused Then we asked them to at least give us a break and split the difference with us to at least make up for their mistake They refused All they would do is extend our payments Big deal We will still have to pay the full amount when we sell the house Totally unfair They told us basically that we should thank our lucky stars we weren t having to back pay for 4 years of hurricane insurance we were supposed to have Please If we had known of this requirement we would have NEVER chosen to go with this company for the mortgage They don t care about losing our business or the bad word of mouth and internet reporting they will receive They NEVER answered us about the reason for the investors requiring this insurance and that is unacceptable Their needs to be big justification for this forced changed if someone is going to lose their home over it If a company is allowed to change their agreement with consumers willy nilly or because of a mistake or a change in policy that will end up amounting to bait and switch tactics and is unethical at the very least They can always use these excuses then and get away with it

My lease was about to be up so I went in to obtain a new car I spoke with representatives came to an agreement then on the day I was supposed to come in and pickup the new car I received a phone call that they werent going to honor the deal that was reached I went in and spoke with the manager who at first was not going to honor the deal but once he realized it was the representatives error and not mine they honored it Or so I thought I went in finally a week later to get the car and of course the lease terms had changed They were only going to honor the price not the mileage that was agreed to but a this point my lease was due to be up so I didnt have a choice but to take a lower mileage lease or be stuck with no car and rushing to find transportation After all this my problems were just beginning They took my lease turn in and then threw an 1800 balance on my credit report After finally getting that taken care of after weeks of going back and forth theyre still reporting a 480 balance This is all after I disputed multiple times because they continuously marked my payments late because of a late fee that they added even though my payments were on time I want the late payments removed from my credit report and I want this false 480 balance removed

Well is very clear that today in Pennsylvania is a crime to be the owner of a property In case your name is on the DEED a criminal Law Firm like Phelan Hallinan or XXXX will find an opportunity to loot your property in a top secret close door act since the laws in PA protects those criminals and you as a person are guilty for having your name on the DEED Their Constitution and Bill of Rights protected property in many ways The Founders were worried that Congress might use the tax system to loot property owners in some states for the advantage of other states Accordingly they required that direct taxes mostly importantly property and income taxes be apportioned among the states Article I Section 2 Clause 3 and Article I Section 9 Clause 4 They also required that indirect taxes such as import duties be levied uniformly I 8 1 and I 9 6 When it became clear that the ban on ex post facto laws was not broad enough to protect property they partially plugged the gap with the Fifth Amendment which 1 prevented any person from being be deprived of his property without due process of laws and 2 required compensation when a property was taken for public use They added a section Article I Section 10 with several provisions protecting financial assets against state governments They granted the federal courts jurisdiction over interstate land claims and interstate debts to limit the extent to which state courts could discriminate against the property rights of out of staters III 2 1 and III 2 2 They added the Eighth Amendment which barred excessive fines With the letter of this lair representing Law Firm Phelan Hallinan I will challenge even the above mention ownership law protected under the Constitution since is a liability to own a property in PA that can be looted vandalize destroyed by criminals only because your name is on PA Deed Even if you do not have any financial obligation under a Mortgage Note your guilt is your name on the DEED only a looter specialist from Phelan Hallinan can invent this garbage For this letter I will say Thank you to this looting expert Law Firm Phelan Hallinan since I will use it in order to challenge the ownership law of our country I will explain below how I am a victim of the most criminal and fraudulent foreclosure done intentionally in a top secret close door act against PA Foreclosure 6 91 done in XX XX XXXX

property for which I do not have any mortgage as well as no financial obligation only because my name is on the DEED I have no financial obligation under any Mortgage Note in this planet The excuse to say that everything looted was also dispose because they could not contact me this is a clear case of primitive case of cover up that I will deal with it in Criminal Court once I get back my property If looter XXXX do not put back all my properties we will meet me in Criminal Court soon and the amount will not be 260000 00 but 10 00 mill This criminal activity was done at the specific request of XXXX since I informed their short term worker XXXX XXXX from XXXX Texas a worked specialized like XXXX in lying covering up and abuses agaist XXXX Clients but I will deal with this lair in Criminal

I defaulted on two student loans I made a payment agreement with one creditor for voluntary payments Another creditor Action Financial Services was threatening to garnish my wages if I did not make an agreement with them I tried several times to contact Action Financial Services but the department I needed was never available I tried to contact them on XX XX 2018 Phone system was down Tried to contact them on XX XX 2018 XX XX 2018 and XXXX department was not available I did manage to talk to someone on XX XX 2018 who stated that they needed proof of my husband s income At the advice of a lawyer he advised not to give my husband s income because it was not his debt and it was a debt before marriage On XX XX 2018 I fax them my financial documents and on XX XX 2018 my wages were garnished On XX XX 2018 I received a phone call from the collector asking about my husband s financial statements and wanted to come up with a payment agreement I advised the caller that they were not going to get my husband s financial information and they are already garnishing my wages so I was not sure why they were still calling me for payment I mentioned to the caller that wage garnishment has put my in a hardship and I was looking for a second job The caller stated that it is federal loans and if I quit my job then they would track me down at my next employer I was willing to work with them to get a payment plan but they are difficult to get a hold of and even after garnishment they will still harass you for payment

This complaint is about how my bank Capital One 360 handled a chargeback dispute with the merchant XXXX XXXX On XX XX XXXX I rented two scooters from the merchant and paid a 500 00 security deposit I was told by the merchant I would receive the deposit back 2 weeks after returning the scooters which I did return the same day I never received the security deposit after two weeks so I called the merchant about it Weeks went by without receiving the deposit back I then filed a dispute on XX XX XXXX XXXX XXXX with my bank and they gave me a provisional credit while they investigated the dispute They then took back the provisional credit back on saying the merchant had provided documentation that settled the dispute I asked the bank to provide said documentation They gave me a letter from the merchant stating that yes they did owe me the security deposit but otherwise did not provide documentation that they actually had returned my deposit Apparently to the bank providing any documentation whatsoever was enough to favor the dispute on the side of the merchant I then called the merchant to see if I could resolve this They went through their documentation and informed me that the bank did a chargeback and took the money from them The bank also took the same money from me Now neither the bank nor the merchant want to deal with me any further The bank has stolen this money from me I have bank statements that show this transaction originally going to the merchant then there is no transaction from them returning the deposit then a transaction for the bank giving me the provisional credit then a transaction from the bank taking the credit back If the merchant is telling the truth and that the bank actually did chargeback from them then this seems to me the bank pocketed this money from us

For the 3rd time my bank is withholding my paycheck entirely The only reason they give me is that they are holding it because they are allowed to do so for 14 days Last time I went into the bank and they told me it was unusual activity because the check was issued from a new source I have worked at the same company for over a year and the amounts of the check are the same This only happens when I use their ATM I went into the bank to deposit my check and the check was cleared immediately When I contact bank of America they say there is nothing they can do although last time this happened someone released the funds immediately They refuse to offer any more information and because the entirety of the check is withheld for 10 days not up to 10 days but 10 days it has caused payments on my account to bounce resulting in additional fees I have proof the check has cleared the business bank but they don t care They are still withholding all of my funds until XX XX XXXX regardless of whether it has posted or not This is some sort of technical error with their atms as this doesn t happen on the mobile app or at a branch when I deposit the exact same check for the exact same amount They are refusing to return my money and refusing to allow stop payment from the other side as the check has already cleared This hasn t happened with anyone else that received a check from our employer and all funds have cleared I spoke to XXXX XXXX who issued the check and they said the check has cleared and they personally are not preventing bank of america from clearing the check I spoke to others online and this seems to be an ongoing issue I believe they are doing this in order to tack on fees as it causes checks and auto deposited items to bounce including my rent payment

In XXXX I requested that the Safe Deposit Box I had with Citibank at their branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX be closed and I turned over the keys and relinquished ownership and responsibility Over the past several years I have received a charge on my Citybank checking account for a Safe Deposit box located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Each time I was charged I contacted Citibank and spoke with customer service who removed the charge and informed me that I would not be charged again It should be noted that when calling customer care at Citibank on more than one occasion I have been transferred to multiple people hung up on and told that they can not help only to be helped when I hung up and called back in On or about XX XX XXXX I received another charge for a Safe Deposit box located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Once again I called Citibank to have the charge removed and to once again explain that I have already turned in the keys to the box and it is no longer mine I requested once again that they stop charging me for the box They removed the charge On or about XX XX XXXX I received a letter from Citibank stating that I was past due on a payment for a Safe Deposit box at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The letter had the Citibank customer care phone number XXXX and I called to once again explain that the box was not mine and that I do not owe the money This time I was told I had to contact the branch manager directly to resolve as customer care can not assist with Safe Deposit rentals This is interesting as the letter from Citibank claiming my rental is past due specifically states If you have any questions or would like to speak with a representative Customer Service can be contacted 24 hours a day 7 days a week at XXXX On XX XX XXXX after several back and forth phone calls XXXX XXXX XXXX the manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that I had two options Option 1 visit the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Citibank will drill out the locks on the box in my presence If the box is empty City Bank will refund me the charges dating back to XXXX not sure how since it is my understanding that all of my charges were reversed anyway and they would not charge me the 150 00 drilling fee If the box contained contents then I would be charged 150 00 drilling fee plus all of the back charges over the past seven or eight years Option 2 do not make any more payments which I havent made since XXXX and after three years Citibank will drill out the box without my presence and as in option 1 only charge me if the box has contents I no longer reside in the State of XXXX and live approximately 2 478 driving miles away in the state of XXXX I can not accommodate option 1 Option 2 does not sound like a viable option as it requires waiting 3 more years to have this issue resolved It appears that Citibank is intentionally trying to obscure and delay any path to resolution This is done by providing a customer care phone number to a department that can not assist with Safe Deposit rentals and telling me that I must wait 3 years Let it also be noted that it is my belief that I have removed any and all contents from the Safe Deposit Box and any contents found do not belong to me and were not placed in the box by myself

We wrote to you very recently regarding a defective item charged on our credit card which the merchant has not in good will tried to resolve for us Discover also failed to resolve this issue for us but also sadly is failing to HEAR us We are not disputing the validity of the charge we are disputing the item or product sold to us as defective The item is a body kit for a 2008 XXXX XXXX XXXX The body kit was not immediately installed because it fell to the very bottom of what we were prioritizing at the time Moving from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX my husband s status as a XXXX Veteran my ten 10 month period of XXXX due to a severe injury the sudden and unexpected death of our beloved dog and faithful protector XXXX who supported my husband thru his XXXX for over eleven 11 years and many other things that took precedence at the time In the interim the merchant issued a credit of 100 00 because the tail lights were never delivered to us as they had been discontinued When we finally had the time the space the health and the money to have the kit installed by our body shop which may have occurred after a respite of many months we were advised by our body shop that the kit sold to us by this merchant did NOT fit The body shop gave us an estimate for their work and clearly noted that this kit does not fit and as such was defective and not usable It appears Discover s basis for not mediating on our behalf and simply taking the merchant s word or testimony though I would like to point out that no one from Discover has ever spoken to either of us thus far to take our statement of facts Discover used as a basis to side with this merchant the fact that we waited too long to install the kit and dispute the item For the many reasons noted above the installation of a vehicle body kit was not a priority at the time But regardless the fact we waited to have the kit installed is irrelevant and should not be a basis to disprove our case and side with the merchant It also appears that Discover sided with the merchant on the basis that as they contend the merchant issued a 100 00 credit to us in XXXX The merchant did issue a credit which we did not remotely remember hence no reference was made about it However the fact that a credit was issued by the merchant because they failed to deliver the tail lights which we had paid upfront does not absolve them nor does it resolve this issue nor does it discredit or weaken our position The reason the merchant issued a credit of 100 00 in XXXX was because the tail lights were never delivered as they had been discontinued The crux of our complaint is that the item in its entirety was sold to us as a defective item It does not fit our 2008 XXXX XXXX XXXX We implore CFPB Discover and specifically Senior Associate XXXX XXXX XXXX from the Executive Office of Customer Advocacy to please as his Office indicates please advocate on our behalf This merchant is not acting in goodwill the merchant whom we can only reach by phone flatly refused to take the item The item which is still new and unused is defective

On XX XX XXXX I contacted Bank of America to advise them that I was overcharged for internet phone service by XXXX on XX XX XXXX for 65 00 and XX XX XXXX for 65 00 The internet phone service was cancelled with XXXX on XX XX XXXX but the merchant continued to charge the credit card account Bank of America failed to investigate the complaint and did not address the dispute within the required 90 day time period requirement as mandated by the Fair Credit Billing Act Instead on XX XX XXXX Bank of America sent a letter indicating that they could not help me because the merchant have the right to receive payment for any services that were rendered which obviously shows that Bank of America did not investigate this matter because the entire dispute hinges on the fact that services were cancelled with the merchant not about the quality of the product service Please review and advise Thank you

As part of this correspondence we therefore provide you with evidence regarding our identified owner accounts deposits and securities in association with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and refer to the documents already provided to you Today we are adding other evidence of investments related to our company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX concerning our shares accounts deposits and securities in connection with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The total volume

XXXX XXXX for our company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX this with reference to last bank statements dated XX XX XXXX already submitted is apparent that our deposits and securities at XXXX XXXX XXXX as at XX XX

XXXX XXXX We have not received any information about our requirements regarding realized transactions it was not possile to enable us access to our own accounts registered stock values and deposits This is clearly evident from our correspondences since XX XX XXXX Not one of these banks has filed tax returns and or declared binding statutory taxes regarding our assets not one informed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX about tax matters and or consequences For years XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for these banks obviously served as a vehicle to operate offshore doing their tax exempt businesses in the

XXXX XXXX has determined tax liability in volume of XXXX XXXX XXXX charged to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX solely with reference to the investments existing at XXXX XX XX XXXX XXXX in the name of our company Therefore it is obvious that banks mentoned above have acted improperly and with full intent most likely also in consultation with each other and abusive have used our own accounts deposits instruments guarantees and securities and our stock values On the part of the aforementioned banks illegal transactions were conducted without our knowledge and without our consent whereby over the stock market thousands of investors in the USA and in other countries were abused By such illegal transactions from our accounts numerous criminal offenses have been committed not only infidelity and

to be relying on their illegal activities to remain undetected Those banks primarily are systemically why because of their size economic importance and also political power they trust that even regulators will not oppose them Also from the letter addressed to XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX XX XXXX it is conclusive to deduce that the banks have been proceeded and will proceed on a systematic and obviously fraudulent basis The criminal activities of these banks in connection with the legally exclusive assets of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX consistently have deceived US INSTITUTIONS This with obvious aim that by misusing our assets as described they gain an improper enrichment in favor of those banks their customers and or third parties In addition one must remember that these activities

the respective acting banks to our disadvantage also the world wide financial stability is extremely endangered This because of the gigantic sums and shifts of assets in the hundreds of Billions of

I was offered mortgage financing by Quicken Loans and was assured that I had been fully approved to move forward with my home purchase with a 15 down payment I went under contract with a property on this basis Upon receiving my full approval letter on or around XX XX XXXX it included the requirement that I pay off an old disputed debt before being able to proceed The disputed debt had been discussed from early in my approval process and I was repeatedly assured by Quicken that it would not affect my financing I had scheduled various inspections for my contracted property but after receiving the approval letter with this payoff requirement I contacted my Quicken mortgage origination agent XXXX XXXX on XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX to confirm yet again that the debt would not need to be paid off before undertaking the costly inspections home inspection structural engineer tests radon lead paint chimney and termite inspections as well as airfare for my father to attend the inspections as he is a XXXX and was to estimate various repair costs XXXX confirmed based on feedback from his underwriters that my financing was still on track and said that the payoff requirement would be removed from my letter Until that point I had been prepared to cancel the inspections but moved forward based on his assurances On XX XX XXXX after I had incurred 2600 00 in inspection related expenses and decided to move forward with the purchase I was told that the debt payoff would in fact be required to enable my financing or that I would need to provide a 20 down payment a 16000 00 increase which was not feasible for me Therefore I lost the property I was assured by XXXX s manager XXXX XXXX that I would be reimbursed for the inspection expenses should I lose the property due to his team s mistakes and internal lapses in communication However Quicken s corporate leadership via XXXX XXXX has limited the compensation to 950 00 as a goodwill gesture provided that I sign a liability release letter arguing that the inspections were at my discretion but acknowledging that I was provided with inaccurate information by their employee and put in a bad position XXXX stated that the corporate rationale for denying my reimbursement is that Quicken does not typically pay for inspections However this situation is atypical as I assume Quicken does not typically mislead clients to their detriment either A goodwill gesture is insufficient and suggests that it s acceptable for me to pay for Quicken s mistakes I have therefore declined to sign the liability release letter and accept the 950 00 payment I was proactive in engaging with Quicken and asked the right questions I relied on their incorrect answers to make my decisions and have lost 2600 00 my desired property and countless hours in the home buying process when I was ultimately ineligible as well as time spent in my efforts to make recoveries from Quicken As a consumer and first time home buyer I relied upon information provided by a well regarded and sophisticated company to my detriment I was informed today XX XX XXXX that the 950 00 goodwill gesture is Quicken s final offer This is a clear lapse in service which they have acknowledged I therefore believe that I am entitled to full restitution 
This is the 2nd time I have had a problem with this company I have brought my account current and made a payment from what they are saying before the statement ending date and I was charged a late fee because they say I have not made a payment prior to the end of XXXX The one I made on XX XX XXXX was to be applied as the XXXX payment This State Farm credit card is such a sham The lower my balance is it seems they keep trying to find a way to keep assessing charges so this balance does not get paid off I currently have no card and no access to credit with them I called on XX XX XXXX to ask if they would waive the late fee as a courtesy The rep said she couldn t because I had already had one waived I explained what happened She got off the line and I suppose inquired of a supervisor and they said no I sent an email on the same day making a request and was given a no answer Obviously I made a mistake and they continue to make me pay for it I also made a XXXX payment just today to satisfy my requirement so I don t get hit with another one 
I filed a prior complaint with this mortgage company Complaint XXXX And they did not address the issues that I specifically asked to be addressed I know that the decree was not sufficient to remove me from the debt that is why I attended several of the foreclosure mediations as stated in my complaint And filed to have me removed from the foreclosure matter At which time I was removed by the Judge and their own attorneys office None of which is stated in the letter they filed as their final findings even though a letter from their own attorneys office was provided to them stating I was withdrawn from the foreclosure and I was not a party to it and had no liability None of this is in their final letter Furthermore my credit report shows that they are showing that I am still late on a mortgage that no longer exists which is ruining my credit further How can you say a person is 120 days late on a mortgage that was foreclosed on 2 years ago You are ruining my credit I was not a party to the foreclosure therefore the word foreclosure should not be on my credit report and furthermore you should stop marking me late on a mortgage that no longer exists This is absolutely insane and needs to stop I want this cleared up immediately

On XX XX XXXX I went to the American Express website and saw the Gold Delta Skymiles card Along with it was a sign up bonus offer The offer stated that if you spend 2000 00 within the first 90 days you would receive XXXX bonus Delta Skymiles Then if you spend an additional 1000 00 after that within the first 90 days you would receive and additional XXXX bonus miles totaling to XXXX bonus miles I immediately called in to apply for the card over the phone and verified that this offer was still valid I was told yes it was and if I got approved I would receive it as long as I meet the spending criteria I was initially declined for approval and then asked for reconsideration The application was approved on XX XX XXXX Within the first 30 days I had already met the 2000 00 of spending And now I have met the additional 1000 00 spending also On XX XX XXXX I received a bonus of XXXX miles instead and immediately called into to American Express to let them know this was the wrong amount They opened up a case investigation for me and gave me a Case Number of XXXX They stated that bun XX XX XXXX the case would have a decision I called in today XX XX XXXX and was told they still dont have a decision 
this problem is with ocwen loan servicing they somehow have taken my morgage from a XXXX escrow overage to now my payments are late and i am now 7000 00 behind i contacted you previously but nothing was done 
On XX XX XXXX our mortgage broker at XXXX XXXX negotiated a 30 day rate lock with Freedom Mortgage at 4 375 with the cost of 1 092 points to obtain the rate We have written verification between us and the broker The broker has phone records between XXXX and Freedom Mortgage as they verbally went through the process with Freedom Mortgage On XX XX XXXX we received an email from Freedom Mortgage with secured documents to sign and verify When we observed the paperwork our cost to close increased by over 16000 00 Freedom Mortgage listed in their disclosure that a cost of 3 776 points would be needed to obtain the 4 375 rate On XX XX XXXX when our broker contacted Freedom Mortgage they claimed it was a computer error that displayed the 1 092 rate There was no contact with the broker on this error between XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX There was no documentation sent to the broker after a verbal walk through of the numbers upon locking the rate We were sent documentation by Freedom Mortgage to sign lock and prepare to close without the primary negotiator our broker being notified We find this highly problematic that Freedom Mortgage 1 did not notify the broker responsible for the transaction of this error 2 did not disclose any error to us the loan recipient and 3 blame it on a computer error though Freedom Mortgage verbally confirmed the entire process with our broker AND avoided any contact with the broker afterwords This contact is considered by me to be phone or email Freedom Mortgage was contacted on XX XX XXXX and will not return to the agreed upon terms of the week prior We are now paying 1 3 points to move our rate down to 4 6xx This is and increase in closing costs an increase in monthly payments AND an increase in overall payments to Freedom Mortgage We have a contractual closing date to meet and this tactic is basically forcing us into worse terms and greater benefit for them Overall I am concerned with the bait and switch tactic employed by Freedom Mortgage when they provided terms verified terms changed terms and did not disclose the change until a document had to be verified a week later Personally I do not believe it is a bait and switch but rather Freedom Mortgage reneging on an agreed upon rate If I were to do that with my mortgage they would seize my property I am also concerned with how many others may have been affected by this computer error if there even was one On any given day I could only assume hundreds if not thousands of people come to terms with Freedom Mortgage If they employed the same tactic with others were the customers aware of the change when they signed the papers Did they feel pressured to sign because a mortgage even at a higher rate is better than no mortgage 
I started paying on my student loan in XX XX XXXX I had one loan in the amount of XXXX which I paid on while I worked I took three deferments year long deferments and I took a couple of deferrments 6 months or less I returned to school and took out a second student loan for my XXXX XXXX which was about 17 000 for one year I took this loan out in XX XX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have paid on these loans over the years and they keep going up instead of down I owe more than I did 20 years ago I pulled a payment history which indicated that nothing in 20 years had been applied to my loan I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and I should have qualified for XXXX forgiveness over the years but they kept changing the guidelines and I never qualified for anything I have XXXX for 24 years in XXXX XXXX which 8 of those years were title one schools I feel that I am entitled to loan forgiveness and I would like to see my orginal loan document because I started with XXXX with a 3 loan They turned me over to a loan servicer who immediately jacked up the loan to 6 without cause I got behind so I went online and made the payment yesterday to bring the account up to date and I received an email today saying that I still owed these payments I checked their data base and looked up payments and it said the payment was pending Maybe I am XXXX years old and I can t keep making student loan payments uinless I keep working

My business checking account with US Bank had 2 disputed charges from the same merchant the first charge was handled properly but the 2nd charge was not handled properly by US Bank they submitted the dispute incorrectly and kept closing it for reasons that had nothing to do with the dispute and now they are refusing to do anything further on it After numerous phone calls speaking with supervisors etc they are stating they are past their timeline to do anything further I have advised the 2nd dispute was not handled properly from the beginning by their side they need to resolve the issue They refuse citing they are past the time line where they can do that I have given them ample opportunity to resolve the issue and they refuse 
On XX XX XXXX I was at XXXX XXXX of XXXX trying to purchase a new vehicle when I was told I had a 25000 00 car loan from Wells Fargo under my name that was opened in XX XX XXXX and was behind on payments I knew for a fact this wasn t me because the only credit that should be reporting under my name is my lease Through XXXX XXXX and a secured credit card through XXXX XXXX XXXX who is my actual bank On XX XX XXXX I called Wells Fargo credit fraud department to report fraud identity theft from this car loan I would first like to add that they made it very difficult for me transferring me to multiple different representatives to the point where I hung up and called back just so I could speak with someone who would actually help me When I got on the line with someone who could actually help I spoke with a gentleman named named XXXX who then transferred me to a lady named XXXX who is part of the customer care team I learned that the person who potentially stole my identity went by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX then transferred me to someone supposedly working in their executive office who went by the name of XXXX XXXX helped me out and made a case out of it and gave me a case number which is Case XXXX and the agent that was assigned to my case went by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX gave me XXXX s phone number with her direct extension so I could contact her I tried reaching out to XXXX the very next day XX XX XXXX and left a voicemail and still to this day have never talked to anyone from Wells Fargo named XXXX XXXX On XX XX XXXX I received a call from Wells Fargo Auto Loans and I was informed that the reason why this 25000 00 car loan was showing up on my credit score was simply because of what she said was a ty po and human error To me this is incredibly careless and in a way disrespectful that someone would not literally take the time to confirm review and confirm again that this is actually the right social security number This is completely unacceptable to me and the 30 60 day window that they told me would take for this to be off my credit report really isn t an option at this point I feel like Wells Fargo handled this situation very poorly for someone who is not even a customer with their bank and I feel like further action should be taken against them Late payments on a car loan significantly destroys your credit which is happening on a daily basis every day that this is on my credit history

Lost my job coming out of college in 2012 so obviously couldn t make many payments on my already predatory loans 15 25 11 5 7 25 Asked Sallie Mae if I could refinance or lower monthly payments they declined abruptly Said I could go into forbearance to stop payments altogether but interest would continue to grow At those interest rates non payments would increase the amount of time I would have to make payments significantly I entered Forbearance and continues to make as much repayment as I could but eventually had to go to XXXX and utilize some of my parents assets in order to get a lump sum loan in order to pay off these higher interest loans at this point they were around 30k at 15 when the initial loan amount was somewhere around 10k 12K If it weren t for my parents to put assets up for me to get a loan I would be drowning in student loan debt right now Not everyone is as lucky as I am and it saddens me to see a promise of a better life via education be taken advantage of by these greedy companies who pose as someone out there to help

I would be very VERY cautious before ever EVER getting a mortgage with XXXX XXXX If you do you will be inundated with mail and email solicitations trying to get you to refinance The mail solicitations they make look like something you need to open and when you do it will just be another sales pitch You get so many that you begin to routinely throw them away rather than waste your time but beware in the process you might throw away their annual escrow analysis So even if you have the mortgage set up to be automatically paid by your bank s bill pay system you will suddenly not be paying enough They will call you and email you non stop to refinance you but will they tell you your payment was a little short Nope So although you send them your payment they will take the payment and sit on it and not apply it because it wasn t the new full amount Then they will report you late to the credit bureau They never sent it back they never called me to let me know they were just holding it in limbo Instead they reported it 1 times 30 days late on my credit report despite that I had paid on time just was short by their new escrow adjustment I brought this to their attention and asked them to correct the error since they actually had almost the entire amount of my payment Their response was This correction would be considered a courtesy and we are unable to honor the request Again be wary of doing business with this company They are very dishonest My credit history is spotless except for this because I always pay my bills on time Please help me get them to fix this error

I took out a short term payday loan with this company I did not realize they had no recourse for early payoff and would make me pay a total of 20 payments in the amount of XXXX I borrowed only 650 00 When my paydate came at an incovienent time I tried to resolve it by asking for a 4 day extension of my payment To this date I have make 5 payments of 190 00 I was told I could skip one payment but they did not tell me until it was too late and loan payment was being processed through my bank The payment was returned and I had already explained that would be the case and I could not control it So far I have paid over 960 00 I understand they need to make money but the fees are exorbitant and present a hardship for me It is my error but I also have never encountered a situation where there was no reduction in payment for early payoff I am happy to pay what I borrowed but I don t think paying over 3000 00 makes complete sense At this point they are saying I still owe over 2900 00 I am not naive to payday loans and its not always the best use of my money but it was a circumstance that I needed to borrow the funds Is there any recourse for this situation that can help to mitigate these high charges 
I am appalled that BofA and XXXX are cancelling their long standing relationships with firearms businesses These cancellations have nothing to do with illegal activity or financial soundness but rather results from virtue signaling on the part of the banks PLEASE do something to stop this social engineering on the part of the banks and ensure equal access to banks for all legal constitutionally protected firms

I sent a written inquiry to the mortgage company on XX XX 2018 asking that they re analyze my escrow account Due to switching home owners insurance to a more affordable policy I had sent the refund check I received from the previous insurance company to the mortgage company and it was clearly marked Attention Escrow which was what I was advised by the mortgage company to do When the mortgage company received the check they applied part of the funds to my monthly mortgage payment and the remainder went toward loan principle instead of going towards the escrow account as intended and requested Because the funds were not applied as requested my escrow account had a deficit during the year end escrow analysis I learned of this error when I received a letter from the mortgage company informing me that my monthly payments were going up instead of down as expected due to cheaper insurance this was an approximate 80 00 difference per monthly payment The mortgage company responded approximately monthly saying in essence we are working on it Now XX XX 2018 113 days after the initial request I call the mortgage company only to learn that the letter I received on XX XX XXXX that states that the mortgage company is in the process of reversing and re applying this transaction and will send me my new monthly payment amount was not followed up on by the company In other words after the mortgage company took 3 months to research the issue and decided they were going fix it as of the date of the XX XX XXXX letter no one did anything When I spoke with the customer service representative today XX XX XXXX he said that it appears no one actually requested the re analysis I ll request that now for you Meanwhile I have been paying 80 00 more per month because this mortgage company is requiring for reasons that are not my fault but a result of their terrible clerical and administrative services

Im now paying about 33 of my pay in garnishment plus family insurance and taxes I cant survive and these companies knowingly keep dealing the punishment I have been exceedingly and unlawfully bullied by this company and its affiliates for far too long they have used unethical and illegal ways to continuously inflict punishment on me These companies have pursued me unrelentlessly which has consequently caused me a lot of public persecution and mental anguish I have nightmares worrying about what they will do to me next what other laws they will break so that they can to inflict more punishment this company has punished me in every way that they can find Criminals continuously find new ways to break the laws they have to stay ahead of the authorities to avoid jail thats how they stay in business deceitfulness is the key There are millions of Americans that get away with never having to pay back student loans why do they consistently pursue me I borrowed XXXX XXXX dollars more than twenty five years ago They are charging me more than forty thousand dollars counting the interest that they have added on with all the payments through the years that I have made toward rectifying this account they arent taking anything off of the principle I am paying for all the people that have let slip through their hands I will never get out of their debt I am paying on a bill that will never get paid off I feel like I am being pimped I go to work and they get paid for the work that I do Its like they own me every time I get paid they get paid I cant make a dollar without these companies getting some of it I think its modern day slavery oh thats right slavery was abolished wasnt it It doesnt feel like it I have chains around my neck hands and ankles I truly understand what it feels like to be owned I have entered and been kicked out of the once in a lifetime program for student loan rehabilitation twice Ha Ha Ha And recently they offered it to me again to me that am the same as admitting guilt Every time that I get close to finishing it there company makes up new ways of kicking me out of the program which was designed to help me get out of default Default for lower income citizen means no credit no loans and garnishment on top of that which means no spare money its not fair I work hard for what little money that I make Navient keeps finding new ways to impose newer and harsher punishment they are standing on my neck how I can get up with that type of weight on me they are a corporation of bullies Not anymore its time I stand up to my bullies Bullying can only be done behind the scenes when a bully is exposed it takes away their power well if no one else is brave enough to shine a light on them than I am In America Navient is one of this nations biggest and cruelest corporations of our history that s why this company and Sallie Mae have so many class action suits against them I put this statement in the letter so that you would know that Im not in a line by myself I enrolled in one of the newer rehabilitation programs which was set by our United States Government to help people get out from under disabling companies like these Sallie Mae and Navient are the two biggest student loan companies in America To enter this program you had to be of low or inadequate income to meet the eligibility requirements I meet the required income level to participate in this program The program stated that if you made ten months consecutively of five dollar a month payments you would be eligible to get your student loans out of default I accepted the terms and signed up to enter the program After the first five payments of five dollars a month your garnishment would be lifted and then you would be able to enter another part of the program that allows you to rehabilitate the student loans at an affordable rate In this part of the program you would no longer be in default and you would actually be paying off the student loans I was quoted about forty five dollars a month for ten years in that part but there branches cant touch you until you are declared out of default I want to pay off my student loans the government finally made it possible for a person such as myself to be able to afford to pay them off and not have to live in a cardboard box on the streets to do so Unfortunately there is an oversized bully blocking my path to rehabilitation this company wants to be a part of the problem they dont want to be a part of the solution they are enablers I want to be in good standings with my student loans and the government I want the American dream which is to have good credit so that you can do anything that you can afford and have the things you want Naviant is stopping me from attaining my dream I didnt break any laws this has happened because I sought higher education This company is getting very rich punishing people American citizens with a microscopic lens on the XXXX XXXX borrowers If I had known what problems these loans were going to cause I would have never applied for them higher education would have had to happen another way which is the way that most Americans operate today under educated and self taught people that wont take out student loans because they dont want to become enslaved to the banking industry These three companies have targeted many of its XXXX consumers they havent moved into the twentieth century yet XXXX people should have equal rights statistically the banking industry imposes stiffer penalties and higher interest rates on its XXXX consumer Navient Sallie Mae and XXXX XXXX each have reputations for these types of practices The student loans that are given out to XXXX students statistically have much higher interest rates than that of Caucasian students Why There is no logical explanation for this type of treatment today the constitution says That all men are created equal XXXX XXXX consumers have the right to an education of equal cost and the opportunity to be educated wherever you can afford to attend We fought long and hard to get these rights lots of lives have been lost so that I would have these rights Society has accepted this why cant they I thought this country was passed the old Jim Crow laws this is another angle towards slavery if you never get out of debt you cant be free of the burden Maybe these companies didnt get the memo slavery is over people let it go Navient started garnishment of my pay in XX XX XXXX I called them to find out how I could stop the garnishment and they quickly passed me on to XXXX XXXX I called and spoke with a representative of the XXXX XXXX collections team XX XX XXXX they were the ones in charge of collection of the garnishment I made my first XXXX dollar payment on XX XX XXXX and my second XXXX dollar payment on XX XX XXXX I had to make two XXXX dollar payments in order to start the process of setting me up on a plan so that I could start the rehabilitation process These were the first payments I thought that I was on my way to a bettering my situation and my life The woman I had spoken with at XXXX XXXX told me to get a XXXX dollar pre paid XXXX card and have all the payments come off of that automatically she said this was what all of her other clients did I went out and got the card as soon as I got paid and I made my first XXXX dollar payment on the account Unfortunately I had been misinformed she misquoted some of the schematics of the program during our conversation I was mislead which caused confusion She told me after the first five payments I would be taken out of garnishment and that they would contact me via US mail to let me know what the next steps in the process of the program would be Our conversation mislead me it also got me kicked out of their program I complained I told them to listen to our conversation it was a recorded call so they would hear where I had been misinformed by their representative They agreed I was told that the conversation was miss leading so the company allowed me to start the once in a lifetime program again I was supposed to make ten consecutive payments to complete their part of the program but she had told me to get a XXXX dollar card which only covered the first five months of the program it wasnt enough to cover the whole program I waited for them to contact me but they never did I soon found out why the garnishment started all over again Navient let me back in the program again but I had to start it all over Ground zero a new garnishment the start of the program at the beginning all over again it was unethical but I was happy they gave me another opportunity a second chance to do this program over On XX XX XXXX I made my first payment and the second on XX XX XXXX of XXXX dollars I was determined not to let this sinerial happen to me again I bought an XXXX dollar pre paid XXXX non reloadable I made sure I had more than enough money to cover the cost for this program I knew that what Navient had done the first time was illegal and I was determined not to give them the opportunity to do that to me again I set the payments up to be automatically deducted as I had done previously there was exceedingly more money on the card I only needed to cover the cost of the ten monthly payments of XXXX dollars a month I wanted to make sure that I would not have any problem making these payments I kept making payments and getting garnished I was quickly approaching month five thats when the garnishment would be lifted I was told to call Navient on XX XX XXXX to make sure they would stop the garnishment I made the call but they didnt stop the garnishment as they were supposed to This company continued to garnish me more than 990 00 to much this is how much the refund check they sent me was for I was overcharged I was a happy camper I had a refund from the company that has been taking most of my earnings and garnishment stopped yeah What happened from here was like a scene out of some kind of espionage spy movie I couldnt have written this I did everything that I was supposed to my payments were being made on the XXXX of every month as they were supposed to be I was on time and on track to finish I was almost out of default I had four payments of XXXX dollar left In the beginning of XX XX XXXX I called Navient to make sure that everything was going according to plan I was compliant I dotted my Is and crossed my Ts I talked to XXXX a customer service agent he assured me that I was on track I was set to have another automatic payment getting ready to come off of the XXXX on the XX XX XXXX The XX XX XXXXpayment came off of the card as it was supposed to on XX XX XXXX I called XXXX XXXX in the beginning of XX XX XXXX to make sure that I was on track I didnt want them finding any issues They dont send receipts this company doesnt let you know anything you have no idea what was going on with your payments or your account except for the garnishments they consistently took the garnishments They dont have to answer to anyone they are above the law at least this is the way they act The representative told me I was on track everything was going good In the beginning of XX XX XXXX I called XXXX XXXX again I wanted to make sure that I would have another payment coming out on XX XX XXXX automatically just relax sir you are on track to finish On XX XX XXXX Navient pulled my account from XXXX XXXX there was no notification I didnt know it had happened It was an intentional ploy to put me back in garnishment an illegal technique that worked There lawyers filed for the garnishment to start again before I even found out that my automatic payment had been missed You can tell this company has done this to other people the crime was premeditated During slavery days the master cut off the foot of the resistant slaves this was to keep them from running away I think this was their intention I will never be free master is keeping me chained up Navient supposedly fired XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX took over my account on XX XX XXXX I didnt know that my account had been switched to another company by law XXXX cant continue take my automatic payment and they cant give my card information to XXXX which I bet is an affiliate company I didnt know that either Navient blatantly played with the law and because of this I was kicked out of the program again There was no way that they could notify me by mail in the time necessary so that I could change my account XXXX automatic payments from one debt collector to the other in the time necessary to make that XX XX XXXX payment I was sabotaged this company boldly manipulated my rights and the laws of the land Navient also tried to make me look like the guilty party and it worked my garnishment started over again I operate by the laws of this United States why shouldnt they I have included a copy of the Non reloadable XXXX that was on file with XXXX XXXX you will see that it still has a 44 00 balance on it There was no reason for me to miss that payment or any of the other payments necessary to finish this program When I called to find out what had happened there representatives were super mean to me almost indignant very very unprofessional disrespectful and degrading This was an intentional and fraudulent action and I am the victim of the crime committed I want restitution I want a resolution and I want my money back I want to be done with this company and the persecuting and unethical ways they do business I would love to be able to deal with an honest company that operates within the laws of the land I do Im not trying to run from my debt Im just tired of dealing with a governmental loan shark This company and its affiliates have imprisoned me life without parole If I dont say anything theyll garnish me until the whole loan is paid off Oh thats right I am only paying on the interest I will never get to the principal They have no right to the money that they are taking from me they committed fraud to get it in fact offering the opportunity for me to do the program again is an admission of guilt During this process I had conversations with the representative of their companies the conversations were recorded I had to talk to two and sometimes three people I have the records of these calls the names times representatives and dates of all conversations Please notify me if you need any of this information I am willing to be a part and or active participant in this investigation I say investigation because laws of this land say that if you are the victim of a crime you have a right for that crime to be investigated I want an investigation They started garnishing me again I called Navient to find out what was going on I was informed that I had missed a payment The way that they changed companies all of a sudden it was an intentional act I am paying for their indiscretions I complained research ticket XXXX I talked to XXXX Escalations team representative on XX XX XXXX she was very nice I had dealt with her on the first ticket but her boss was very nasty and argumentative it was XXXX manager she wouldnt give me her name These representatives felt as though a call from a new collections company that I had no idea was involved in this process was all the notification that I needed Navient kept the garnishment in place I am garnished about 340 00 dollars every two weeks I have been garnished unfairly for the last year XX XX XXXX to the current date XX XX XXXX I could understand this punishment if I had not been compliant but I was I followed the plan exactly I did what I was supposed too It was a predatory act I have more than paid this company what I owe them They arent even taking any of the money that is being taken from me off of the principle of this loan I have already paid back more than I borrowed its as though I am paying nothing what a nightmare I am a firm believer that crime doesnt pay but after what this company has done to me and allot of other American consumers its truly hard to keep believing this This company has a tremendous amount of class action suits against it I wonder how many of them are because of ethnicity I bet more than half statistically I truly believe if I wasnt XXXX XXXX XXXX that they wouldnt have taken the same approach with my account that they have taken It is my firm belief that I have been discriminated against based on my race color I am a XXXX XXXX and very proud of it I have endured the racism and bigotry of this country throughout my life some of that will always be there I am immune to most of it history has harden me but what these companies have done Sally Mae included has bought our past very blatantly to our present I feel like they are treating me as master would treat a smart XXXX XXXX they took me out to the shed and gave me a good beating Please check the statistics I guarantee many other XXXX consumers have claims against them very similar to the reasons that I have given just like mines These people have endured the same journey that I am enduring Im sure that I am just one person in long line of people with skin just like mine XXXX XXXX and Navient have used the ambulance chasing lawyers and unethical collections officers that they employ to create very specific gray areas in between the XXXX and white writings of the laws of our land They have done this to commit very calculated illegal and predatory crimes I am one of the victims of these crimes I was unlawfully kick out of a payment program that I would have successfully finished I didnt fail to make the payment on time they changed the company that I had to make the payment too I had three more automatic payments to make I had already made six consecutive on time payments of XXXX dollars a month this is the criteria for the program The new collections company referred me to Navient which referred me to XXXX XXXX we were trying to get to the bottom of the new garnishment Once I explained to them that I was set up on automatic payments plus I still had the card to prove that I was being honest I still have the non reloadable Pre Paid XXXX this card still has about forty four dollars left on it XXXX representative told me that Navient would probably just let me finish out the program without punishment after I explained the details of the crime that they had committed check the recorded conversation I called and tried to explain the situation to the Navient representatives they didnt agree their representatives took a very hard and unprofessional stance during the conversation we were having I have been garnished for the last year more than six thousand and five hundred dollars wrongfully and over ten thousand dollars over the last three years I have paid more than I ever borrowed this last year was an evil attempt at no good the money was illegally and wrongfully taken from me I want my money back I deserve my money back especially the XXXX XXXX from the last year I am asking for my money back These companies blatantly broke and rewrote the laws to put more money in their pockets Its not fair I have suffered for their self righteous ways they are not doing right by the American public I dont know how many people that they have done this too and gotten away with it but I pray that you wont let them get away with it I hope not to be one of the people that have let this company get away with it again I am a hard working honest man I live by the saying An honest days pay for an honest days work These companies are taking my hard earned money they used sneaky replicated and rotten techniques to do it Its robbery they are robbing me every payday Whether its done with a gun or a pen robbery is robbery and thats illegal its against the law Please help me fight for my rights no one should have to endure the punishment that I have from this company I have had to sacrifice a lot I have lost a lot Please help me stop the downward spiral that these companies are trying force upon me Its not fair now nor has it been in the past judge in my favor please Its time to put the racist and their prejudice ways behind us thats our past scars that keep opening Bigotry is ingrained in our history but if we stand up to prejudice it wont have to be a part of our future It has been an honor addressing such great minds please make the right judgment Thank You

My Discover Miles credit card got shut down with an meaningless reason we are no longer be able to meet your servicing needs and the customer service has no clue about this situation Only said the bank closed my credit line because of business which is not relevant to me because I paid every bill on time since I have the card This inconvenience made me lose chances to purchase lots of good deals and earn miles 
My husband died in XXXX Our home loan was in his name only Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC required that I obtain Letters of Administration to be able to speak to them about the loan I did so Then when I was in the process of applying for a loan modification there was a problem with one final document My Relationship Manager had mismarked an item on the document I spoke to him and others about correcting the item to no avail On XX XX XXXX Ocwen foreclosed on my home When I learned of this in early XX XX XXXX I emailed every department in the company The research department reached out to me wanting evidence of the issue I had that held up the application which I provided to them They then requested new documents with which to proceed with the modification notifying me on XX XX XXXX Please be informed that our records show that we received the documents on XX XX XXXX Please allow 3 5 business days for the information to be reviewed to confirm we received all the necessary documents In addition we have referred the issue to the appropriate team who can take back the Foreclosure Since that date I have been told that my modification was under review My account page on the Ocwen website showed that the property had been foreclosed but that I was under review as well On XX XX XXXX A gentleman knocked on my door told me that he had bought my house and showed me the Deed in his name I verified it with the Assessor s Office So while I was under review Ocwen both foreclosed and sold my home I ve contacted the Ombudsman for Ocwen and XXXX XXXX each is looking into the matter On XX XX XXXX I was served a 3 day Eviction Notice I ve called left messages with Ocwen emailed them I ve had no return contact as of yet Tomorrow I m meeting with XXXX XXXX XXXX hoping to fight the eviction at least long enough to get positive results from Ocwen Any help you can be with this would be appreciated beyond words 
I called XXXX about 3 years ago to find out if I qualified for student loan forgiveness since I am a XXXX by profession I have made 108 payments since I was hired in XX XX 2009 They are telling me today they I need to reconsolidate my loan and begin the 120 payment process all over I have never missed a payment and my loan was sold to Navient by XXXX I am very upset about this and would like instructions on how to move forward Do I reconsolidate Do I get an attorney Where do I go from here 
I called into Wells this morning after receiving an email from XXXX XXXX my Home Preservation specialist stating that the Wells Fargo decision was made in regards to my loan modification application My loan modification was denied yet again but this time for Wells Fargo s use of incorrect income information that they manipulated by and leaving out my contributor income even if we are still evicting a tenant so that we can move in and I provided proof of this fact Also they are denying me without ever requesting the documents that they would have needed from him to complete a successful review and by arbitrarily lowering my monthly income to the amount of 1700 00 per month from a gross monthly average of XXXX month just commission over the prior 2 year tax period My loan was originally a XXXX XXXX XXXX adjustable mortgage and I have been trying to get my loan modified with Wells Fargo to no avail since XX XX XXXX They have manipulated the numbers several times in XX XX XXXX when I applied for modification previously they told me that they were still reviewing my file which was complete and the income was all there and denied me just 3 minutes before the foreclosure sale telling me that the reason was because my contributor needed to contribute another few hundred dollars a month which was well within what he could afford and so and was willing to do I even submitted a new contribution letter immediately reflecting that amount which the contributor had signed and which Wells Fargo just ignored when it was faxed into them This forced to file bankruptcy so that I could continue to pursue workout options through making payments on the past due balance Therefore I paid a bankruptcy attorney reversed the sale on my home and this allowed me to finally begin making payments through a trustee but at a very high monthly rate almost 6000 month for a home with a loan of just around 500000 00 360000 00 principal total on it Therefore today I decided to reapply for modification and focus on that as the best outcome for me to keep my home What I did learn inXX XX XXXX when I applied for a modification was that for a commission earner like myself Wells needed to average my income over the past 2 years because I my income fluctuates but that would be the truest assessment of my earnings That is what I understood the proper way to review my file was and this was echoed by several underwriters as well In XX XX XXXX I was told to choose a time period prior to being informed that for me a 2 year period was necessary after the fact of being denied This resulted in my Wells Fargo calculated income being about 3 200 mo down from about 3600 00 which I had done my best to calculate over a 6 month period It appears that with todays underwriter XXXX XXXX she was told to just deny my modification EVEN IF I QUALIFY and that is why wells is giving reasons that do not make sense as to why they are denying me this time around I feel that they are not manipulating HOW they are calculating my income just to push through a denial and not using the method of averaging the past two years gross income from real estate So In my current application which was denied without any request for documents from the current underwriter when I have appox 3 200 month just real estate income plus an amount my contributor is willing to pay approximately 3300 month as needed and that comes out to about 6500 month in income My underwriter was XXXX XXXX underwriter working with XXXX XXXX Home Preservation Specialists the document gatherer processor XXXX was happy with how quickly I got documents to him on the first day he contacted me about my file I provided to him everything he asked for and within the same day He even sent my file to the underwriter without my XXXX but I remembered that he had requested for it and forwarded it to him that afternoon also which he thanked me for remembering The second reason Wells gave me for denying my loan modification was that they needed additional proof of occupancy in the form of a car insurance bill from the contributor XXXX and two more proof of occupancy showing that XXXX and I lived at the property This is further proof that the underwriter XXXX XXXX never looked at my file seriously I explained to XXXX XXXX XXXX processor at Wells Fargo Home Preservation the day he requested supporting documents from me and the day that I submitted them for a complete file that that there are non paying tenants at the property that had been there for over a year and that I have been trying to evict for over 8 months since they had been telling me that they would pay so I could pay Wells and my trustee for the prior 4 months and who finally signed an agreement to leave so that they will be moving out in two months XXXX XXXX XXXX at Home Preservation had acknowledged that the tenants were in the property and requested that I send in documentation showing that they will be moving out signed by their attorney which I DID and uploaded it to the loan tracker but now they are insisting that I show proof that I am living at the property which makes no sense I provided XXXX s auto insurance bill this morning anyway XXXX has mail going to several places because he has family in the area This should not be a surprise that some sensitive material would not want to be sent to a tenant that has held our mail in the past This Proof of Occupancy should not be requested if tenants are holding up the property and had even previously held my only short sale offer from Wells Fargo which I requested that Wells Fargo not send to the property and now refuses to review me for any other short sale options The tenants have taken my mail and I don t even want any mail at all going to the property Either way why wasn t Wells XXXX XXXX requesting this while I was still under review for the past 3 weeks if this modification is truly being reviewed in good faith Then about 3 weeks ago when I finally got through to Wells and was finally assigned a Home Preservation Specialist XXXX XXXX at the start of my file being reviewed I received a letter from their Wells Fargo bankruptcy attorney addressed to my bankruptcy attorney in my prior complaint last month with CFPB XX XX XXXX stating that my name was not on the authorization to speak with wells myself and that my modification file was not complete so that is why they denied me for modification that I had never even yet been reviewed for when in fact my file was just nearing the first day of review with the underwriter XXXX XXXX Had Wells Fargo already intended to deny me before even beginning to review my documents is that why no supporting documents were requested from me by the underwriter and my file was not read carefully because the underwriter never even looked at and did a real analysis of my file Regarding the Wells Fargo Authorization Form I completed it fully and properly with the loan number and attached a DocuSign certification with all of my information including name on it attached here wells fargo forms have no field for the senders name It took me 3 attempts and three other consumer financial protection bureau complaints to have Wells Fargo finally acknowledge the several authorizations I sent into the re entry team when I reapplied for modification this time around As you can see wells fargo pays games with its consumers to force the desired outcome even if the customer is trying to modify in good faith I was finally assigned to Home Preservation after being told several times by the re entry team that they could not acknowledge receipt of any of my modification documents nor would they tell me what was missing or if anything was missing they simply said they wouldn t tell me anything and that was it for my own loan There are so many reports of unethical activity by Wells Fargo in the news and which has allowed me to see my struggles and rude insulting comments that have been made by their employees towards me as unfair and I realize of how my attempt to modify is actually being handled It has allowed me to see what is happening as not right ethical or in good faith This is not good consumer lending practices I don t know why Wells is using unethical practices to constantly deny me for modification but something seems odd I don t know who will benefit from my home going to sale but I would imagine someone will and I will find out whom and make the connections I have made payments this year and I would like to continue to do so at the new modified amount 
case XXXX The Huntington National Bank I received a letter from The huntington National bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ohio XXXX regarding lender paid private Mortgage Insurance I ask the PMI department to drop the 48 00 I received a letter informing me that I have reached the 78 LTOV and 5 years requirement to have PMI drop but the bank will not drop the insurance I have called sent in letters also emailed the company 
My loan was initially given to XXXX XXXX or some agency and after that it s been transferred to XXXX Department Whenever I call XXXX they threaten with interest rate non negotiable options don t work with any plan they were wronged and fraudulently put forbearance on my account several times and now I have more than 10000 00 of interest without my concern There is a huge fraud going on in XXXX and they are putting wrong information XXXX never explained about any deferement forbearance or any such thing 
We want the CFPB to have Ocwen show how they could service a loan for a company that was out of business before we got the loan We would also like the CFPB about Ocwen s breach of contract Ocwen started servicing our loan XX XX 2013 They applied the first payment on time but charged us a late fee Also we would like the CFPB why they breach our contract from XX XX 2013 XX XX 2013 without paying our homeowner s insurance When we requested a rescission all of the TIL disclosures were incorrect and Ocwen had been in breach of our contract for failure to pay XXXX for 6 months This violates RESPA and Georgia Residential Mortgage Act False disclosures are the same as non disclosures 
I applied for a credit line on XX XX XXXX which was approved for 100000 00 I made payments on the account until XX XX XXXX at which point I felt behind 2 payments On the 3rd month I reach out to the service department of Bank Of America to make a payment in full for the amount due so I could bring the account to current status At that point I was told that the account had been charge off with no prior notice no mail notice email or phone call And they had all my current information I was told their was nothing they could do for me The only thing I could do was to pay the amount due in full 100000 00 and that wouldn t even remove the charge off from my credit report I have tried to make arrangements to correct this account on my credit report and bring the account to 0 00 balance but they refuse to work with me The only answer I heard from them was we can t offer you a settlement you must pay the full amount but we can t remove the charge off from your credit report The last time I reach out to Bank of America I even requested to speak to the person in charge of the financial department to see if I could get a settlement and the answer was the same WE CAN T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU YOU MUST PAY THE AMOUNT IN FULL 
I have 2 mortgages with GMFS I have had one mortgage for nearly 4 years My bank allows me to pay bills through their site and I paid my mortgage with the same address for years My bank and mortgage company are different companies Last month GMFS notified me that my loan has been purchased by XXXX XXXX XXXX but its still GMFS The lender has not technically changed But they failed to receive my payment that I had sent to the same address for GMFS for years So I changed the address Now my payments have been returned because its not made to XXXX XXXX XXXX but its coming from a GMFS letterhead Its still GMFS Its not like I was sending payments to XXXX or XXXX XXXX This is ridiculous I believe its deceptive banking which causes unnecessary confusion to cause customers like myself who have paid on time every time to incur expenses This needs to be investigated

In XX XX XXXX after hurricane Irma I contacted Mr Cooper to obtain an extension on my loan My previous experience with and understanding of how loan extensions work is that usually several months payments are pushed to the end of the loan and the interest amount due is added to the principle balance making those payments come due at loan maturity date This was my understanding of what was going to transpire when I contacted Mr Cooper and what the representative at Mr Cooper led me to believe was going to take place if I met the terms of the agreement I received a follow up letter from Mr Cooper dated XX XX XXXX approving my request and confirming our agreement The letter states that the agreement begins on XX XX XXXX and that I am to pay XXXX dollars for the first 2 months XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX and then 250 00 per month for another 2 months XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX I met the terms of the agreement and made the required payments of 500 00 on time as stated in this document Then inXX XX XXXX after this 4 month plan ended I began making my normal monthly payments on the loan I made XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX but when I sent the XX XX XXXX payment in it was refused and refunded to my checking account It was at this time that I started getting letters demanding the payments in full that I had skipped during the 4 months and threatening to foreclose and they would not accept any more payments from me In fact they rejected my XX XX XXXXpayment and returned it to my bank account I have been assigned to numerous account representatives all of whom have been very unresponsive I finally did speak to someone and was told there was a meeting in XX XX XXXX by the management several months after Mr Cooper had agreed to assist homeowners and they had a change of heart on assisting any homeowner that was past due at the time the agreements were made They also told my daughter the same thing when she called So several months after pulling all these homeowners into this forbearance agreement they decided not to honor the agreements they had made with those homeowners who were past due at the time of offering assistance and that they were going to issue demands for payment of all the funds they had told those homeowners not to pay for 4 months So once they pulled them in got them further behind by deceiving them with these agreements they then decided to send demand letters and foreclose These are deceptive unethical and possibly illegal practices on the part of Mr Cooper How can they entice homeowners into not paying their mortgage payment pulling them further into arrears enough so that they had grounds for foreclosure You cant make an agreement then decide several months later in a meeting that you are going to change the terms of those agreements after you led the mortgage holders to believe that they were being offered assistance I would like Mr Cooper to do what they told me they were going to do and extend those payments to the end of my loan You may correspond with me or my daughter

On XX XX XXXX a transaction began pending on my account from XXXX in the amount of 47 00 At that time the total available funds in the account were 63 00 The transaction posted successfully on XXXX leaving a balance of 15 00 the same day a transaction from XXXX XXXX began pending on the account for 26 00 I checked my account that day and saw 2 transactions pending on the account one for 26 00 and an overdraft fee for 37 00 At that time I assumed that the overdraft fee was for the pending transaction for 26 00 from XXXX XXXX I called TCF with the intention of transferring funds into the account to cover the 11 00 that the account was overdrawn hoping that the overdraft fee would be removed Upon speaking to the TCF agent I was informed that the overdraft fee was for the XXXX transaction that had posted that day and that a second overdraft fee would be assessed for the XXXX XXXX transaction When I asked how they could possibly charge an overdraft fee for a transaction that had posted with sufficient funds to cover the amount and leave an available balance the TCF agent told me that even though the transaction posted leaving an available balance the bank had re directed funds away from the posted transaction to cover the pending transaction because the transaction for 26 00 from XXXX XXXX began pending on the account the same day Later on XXXX I called TCF again to inform them that the transaction from XXXX XXXX had actually posted in error The first agent I spoke with told me that I could dispute the transaction after it posted and that if the merchant agreed to credit the account the associated overdraft fees would also be credited back to the account I called the merchant XXXX XXXX to let them know about the error and that per the bank agents instructions I would dispute the transaction The merchants representative said that they would make a note on the account and they would be happy to work with me to resolve the issue On XXXX 2 transactions posted to the account the 37 00 overdraft charge for the XXXX transaction and the transaction for 26 00 from XXXX XXXX leaving the account overdrawn by 48 00 Please refer to screenshot TCF1 I called TCF to dispute the XXXX XXXX transaction The agent transferred me to a team leader who was extremely rude and refused to help me with the dispute I asked her if the overdraft fees would be credited to the account if the merchant agreed to credit the account without filing a dispute and she stated that the overdraft fees would be reversed After the difficulty dealing with TCF agents I was able to rectify the error with the merchant The Customer Service Manager at XXXX XXXX agreed to credit my account for 26 00 On XXXX another 37 00 overdraft fee posted to the account leaving the account overdrawn by 85 00 then on XXXX a credit for 26 00 from XXXX XXXX posted to the account which left the account overdrawn by 58 00 This amount clearly reflects that there was an available balance due on the account when the overdraft fees were charged XXXX XXXX 74 00 74 00 XXXX 58 00 Please refer to screenshot TCF2 Firstly TCF bank had no right to charge an overdraft fee for the XXXX transaction on XXXX I believe that they should credit my account 37 00 for this fee Secondly TCF has not credited my account for the overdraft fee for the XXXX XXXX transaction as multiple agents stated that they would they should credit my account 37 00 for this fee as well The total credits to which I am entitled total 74 00 and should bring my account balance back to 15 00 Please refer to screenshot TCF3

On XXXX XXXX 2017 XXXX sold me XXXX Bitcoin Cash BCH at an fraudulent unfair price of 6000 00 I then proceeded to sell the XXXXBCH at 9500 00 only to have my sell order rejected because they shut down the exchange due to a computer glitch on their behalf I lost out on a sale of about 100000 00 I came back the next day to find the price crashed down and not able to sell Because of their computer malfunction I decided to hold off on any trading on the account until the issue was resolved I have not received any sort of response from them and they ve hung up the phone the one time I was able to get through to customer support Because of this it caused me to lose out on an Ethereum position that should be equal to XXXXeth not to mention time energy and money spent trying to resolve the issue 
The issue i m having is with a piece of accounting software XXXX withdrawing money out of my account unauthorized I signed up for their software to handle my book keeping and payroll for my business Generally speaking I they do checking account verification via micro transaction verifications In this case however they only withdrew money of my account and never deposited anything The withdraws were made from my account on XX XX XXXX for XXXX and XXXX I reached out to their support today XX XX XXXX and they informed me that they are unable to offer refunds While I authorized the micro deposits and withdraws they never deposited any funds into my account and have thus stolen from me It s obviously a trivial amount but it is unacceptable that they do this to me and who knows how many others 
On XXXX XXXX 2017 a transaction of XXXX via CoinBase was supposed to be deposited into my checking account The transaction still shows that it is in a Pending State and I have yet to receive my funds I have submitted an IT ticket for help as well as called customer support and have gotten no information as to when this transaction will be completed

Up until 2013 I was a customer of Bank of America I had perfect standing accounts at all banks and financial institutions and a great credit score Sometime later in 2013 I had deposited a check from my partner from a different bank to my personal account at Bank of America I had no idea that the check would bounce but it did weeks after the deposit I had used the funds and was unaware of the account status until returning from my trip When I was back in town and made aware of the issue my account was already closed charged off and I was reported to all credit agencies and put on XXXX XXXX I made the account current but the bank made it clear that the reporting decision was out of their hands and did not give me any direction on how to dispute the situation Not only was I reported to XXXX XXXX but I was also reported to all financial institutions and credit agencies as a person who has committed fraudulent activity I was wrongfully reported to the agencies as a fraudulent customer and this has not only defamed my character at a life destructive level for me but it has specifically caused me major financial loss in every category of my life business and personal and has led to my current situation of being supported by the government for the very first time in my life I was a successful young entrepreneur and professional before this incident and I am now suffering from major mental issues and emotional distress caused by the unlawful decision action by Bank of America I have tried resolving this matter directly with Bank of America from the very beginning with multiple attempts at a settlement and resolution but each time was involved in a process that took 6 months or longer to receive a general rejection at the end with no legitimate explanation The case number I was assigned for the claim by BofA was XXXX This situation has not only banned me from opening a bank account financial account anywhere in the country since the incident but has also led to the closing of my businesses due to my inability to have any financial account loss of business partners and trust with individuals who were made aware of this situation since I had no control of the information decreased my personal credibility and professional credibility and credit scores across the board and has ultimately led to my inability to continue my lifestyle and professional life I have lost everything I have worked so hard for since I was a child 
I bank with XXXX XXXX and was using XXXX the XXXX XXXX startup to invest in cryptocurrency I have since decided to end that activity and tried to withdraw funds from XXXX back to XXXX XXXX I initiated the withdrawal of 5600 00 on XX XX XXXX A day later I was told that the transfer failed and my account was frozen This is all the information I was given XXXX does not have a customer support phone number and multiple attempts to reach them via email have failed I have wired multiple much larger amounts through XXXX XXXX to XXXX so I expect XXXX XXXX would recognize XXXX as a trusted source Therefore I believe the fault somehow lies with XXXX 
Dear Sir Madam I transferred XXXX to Coinbase a cryptocurrency platform On XXXX 2017 from my XXXX bank account XXXX The transfer payment ID is XXXX I have transferred the payment using SEPA I emailed coinbase several times but their reply is very generic saying that we have escalated your case and afterward no response According to the company my transferred payment should show in my coinbase account in 10 business days but almost a month has been passed now I am in dire need of my funds Currently I am a student in the XXXX at the moment and is suffering from XXXX conditions I need to pay my hospital bills as I am an XXXX XXXX I dont have access to free healthcare I have written to coinbase several times but no avail I want to cancel my transfer order and want my money back in my bank account to pay the bills I have also written to coinbase CEO XXXX My case was escalated two weeks ago and still no follow up

On XX XX 17 I purchased a money order for XXXX from money gram at XXXX The money order was stolen from the rent office along with multiple other money orders by an unknown person I called money gram and they informed me that it had been cashed XX XX 17 and that I needed to prove that it wasnt me who cashed it They gave me the option of paying XXXX dollars to receive a picture of the check and at what location it was cashed at I agreed When I got the copy of the money order at the time it was cashed it had been rewritten and my apartments name was no longer on the front of it with No signature on the back Then they told me XXXX XXXX XXXX was the back that cashed the money order but when I went to chase they told me that the account money gram is saying the money order was cashed in does not exist and they are not responsible for cashing the money order At that point I decided to turn to consumerfinance because Im being lied to and misled my money gram to my knowledge they are suppose to contact the bank the money order was cashed at and ask them to open a fraud investigation but Im left doing everything my self with no help
On XXXX XXXX around XXXX XXXX I wired 20000 00 to XXXX Subsidiary of XXXX from my bank account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Their website clearly states that wire transfers will be posted the same day if done before XXXX XXXX and the next day if received after XXXX I confirmed with their bank that my wire transfer was received and deposited with Coinbase within 30 minutes of being sent I have sent literally hundreds of emails asking where my money is and have only gotten a couple auto replies essentially stating that my case is being reviewed The couple times I ve had the 4 plus hours to wait on hold to speak with a human being I was told that phone support can not help with deposit issues It s been over 6 weeks with NO specific updates or acknowledgement This is absolutely rediculous XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date XXXX XXXX XXXX From XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 20000 00 Ref XXXX

My husband and I requested a deferment through XXXX XXXX and they told us what we needed to pay and when in order to obtain the deferment on the payment They sent us an agreement which we signed and mailed back We have paid exactly what they told us to and when to pay it and now they have reported lates on our credit and stated that they did not receive the signed agreement back within 10 days so the deal is null and void This is NOT acceptable We mailed the agreement back and its not my fault if they did n t get it We paid the terms as agreed as we were instructed They need to honor the agreement reverse the additional late fees etc and correct the negative reporting to the credit agencies I could see it if we did NOT pay the agreement as required but we did This is the holiday season and I am sure the post office is buried and the signed and executed letter is either lost or delayed due to the volume of mail that goes on at this time 
Yesterday at XXXX XX XX XXXX I went to check on my XXXX on the Coinbase app and my account said that i sent all of my money to Coinbase The app says i gave coinbase my money at XXXX XXXX At no time ever did I authorize this transfer or was not made aware of the transaction from XXXX They Stole my money without permission did not inform me of what happened to my money i waited on the phone for 40 minutes waiting on a representative to assist me with the problem and the phone call disconnected They were of no help to me and had no permission to sell or use my coins in anyway They took XXXX XXXX which is 510 00 and sent it to themselves now i have a XXXX balance in my Coinbase account I tried chatting online with the company about what happened and got no help either I made my initial purchase for the Coin on XX XX XXXX so Coinbase took my money in under 10 days i have already lost 190 00 on the coins in that time now i have lost 700 00 total because Coinbase took my coin i will most likely lose more money if the coin appreciates while this claim is ongoing Coinbase needs to give me my funds back 
Hello Over the past weekend I attempted to send a 1000 00 deposit to CoinBase com and was promised a date this amount would be available XXXX XXXX XXXX This money is not available and I the transaction status on coinbase com is no longer present despite my bank registering that the 1000 00 was sent I would like an explanation for this and a notification for when this issue is resolved 
I called to increase the limit for a withdrawal out of my Coinbase account from XXXX to XXXX A person answered and helped to assist me I just noticed that instead of assisting me he stole XXXX XXXX 9800 00 from my account He initially said he was initiating withdrawal to my bank and I had XXXX XXXX XXXX account and to expect the money shortly I had no reason to doubt that I was being conned or scammed He disconnected the phone call around XXXX and never answered again His phone number is XXXX XXXX and he went by the name of XXXX XXXX His location is in XXXX NY Coinbase California XXXX XXXX United States XXXX XXXX United States of America California XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX wwww coinbase com Are there any other witnesses or victims to this incident XXXX XXXX XXXX representative was on the phone during the conversation on a 3 way call If you have reported this incident to other law enforcement or government agencies please provide the name phone number email date reported report number etc XXXX Police here in XXXX and XXXX
In XX XX XXXX we paid off in full over a year in advance our lease financing contract XXXX XXXX would not give us a return shipping address at that time to return our copiers 10 in all as per the lease Our lease ends XX XX XXXX and once again we requested a return address as well as a buy out price as per the lease CIT has failed to provide a return address or a buyout price With respect to the buyout price we did receive the attached email stating that the buyout quote would need to come from XXXX XXXX our local copier vendor which no longer owns the copiers The buyout price was many multiples 35000 00 vs 2000 00 of the fair market value called for under the lease according to competing copier vendors After questioning other copier vendors I am told that it is a fairly common practice for financing companies like CIT to conspire with the local copier vendor to hold the customer hostage so that the customer has little choice but to renew their lease or enter a new lease with the local vendor The attached email is direct evidence of that practice as CIT is directing us to the local vendor which does not own the copiers to set the price while at the same time refusing to give us a return address This practice is both fraudulent deceptive and coercive and the financing company has every incentive to do this to get continued future referrals of business from the local vendor 
I began receiving harassing phone calls nearly everyday I tried to explain I will send a check as soon as I get paid The amount they required was more than I could afford that week This week I sent them a check in the full amount requested The phone calls came every day and grew more and more aggressive They threated to call me 3 times a day and claimed they have every right to do so legally despite the fact I told them they have been paid They continued to repeat themselves redundantly The caller collector insisted she had confirmed with her manager and she was with in her legal right Part of the reason my account went into collection status is due to the fact they stopped sending me a bill US Postal service and the last few bills they did send are clearly printed XXXX due XXXX owed dated XXXXXXXX XXXX I may have misunderstood the rehab program believing that my account had been settled XXXX XXXX 13 months later after no contact I got a letter and began getting calls from their collections I immediately budgeted for a payment and made the full payment requested about a week later when I had the money Today I continue to get calls threatening to call me three times a day in addition to the interrogating questions I believe this to be excessive abuse of their authority and illegal behavior 
A fraudulent transfer on XXXX XXXX XXXX was made from our joint savings account to a man named XXXX XXXX for 2400 00 through XXXX I think it goes without saying that we do not know this man We noticed this charge on XXXX XXXX XXXX and attempted to take swift action by calling Bank of America to file a claim but were unable to at that time due to office closure on weekends In a second attempt to contact anyone who may have additional knowledge on addressing our issue we also went to the Bank of America located in downtown XXXX XXXX to consult with an employee This inept employee could only provide a phone number for us to call which we later learned was a wrong number On Monday XXXX XXXX XXXX at roughly XXXX XXXX my husband checked our savings account to reference it as he prepared to call Bank of America to file the claim To his shock he saw that a second fraudulent transfer was made This time the transfer was made to a XXXX XXXX for 2400 00 again through XXXX and to an individual whom we do not know The Bank of America associate assisted my husband with filing a claim to report the two fraudulent transfers and in response he placed a hold for 880000 00 on the account He explained that it may take up to 10 days to investigate the claim but provided vague details regarding next steps On XXXX XXXX my husband called Bank of America to follow up on our claim The Bank of America associate explained that they investigated the claim and found that there was no indication that it was a fraudulent transfer because the transfer was made on the same device This argument is weak to assume that fraud can only occur if using different devices He was speechless to learn that they would not be able to get our money back because they deemed the transfers legitimate I am concerned that this issue is not being handled correctly and no protections are in place when making large by our standards transfers While we have asked to have Bank of America look at our claim again the associate has advised us to take legal action I understand that this is his job to explain alternatives but for individuals who are trying to get their money back unfortunately we do not have discretionary funds to afford a lawyer While this amount may seem low in comparison to the billions of dollars being shuffled through the bank system this 4900 00 is important for us to have for a rainy day and clearly is it flat out wrong to steal from people In addition to trying to get our money back I am concerned about the integrity of the Bank of America online platform and its ability to detect identity theft I demand action from Bank of America and the agencies that are meant to protect consumers We have filed a report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Police Departments and waiting to hear from them I am at a loss as to what other steps we need to take to recuperate our stolen money so I urge you to hear us out and help us with this matter as soon as possible 
Over the past 13 years the student loans I took out to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX have ballooned out of control due to the errors omissions and deceptive practices of Navient formerly XXXX XXXX Original balance on a loan I started was for 26000 00 and another which I have yet to see my signatory document for 19000 00 total 45000 00 increased while I was paying the monthly payments as I was able to 76000 00 Now I am not a finance major but even with a few forebearances that I requested when there were financial troubles but it seems that misallocation of my payments to forebearence fees erroneous late fees etc caused capitalized interest build up during my repayment program So even though I was making payments the balance only always rose Even when I requested a fixed payment extended plan which would increase the overall sum I was paying they did not put me in that program and with variable rates increasing the payment kept increasing No one ever advised other alternatives to forebearance nor did they advise that the interest first payment structure was going to be used So although I made 13 years of payments nothing was ever applied to the principal balance and with capitalized interest my balance has only increased I am a teacher and I can only shake my head that the deceptive practices of Navient XXXX XXXX are allowed to continue like this When my repayment program shifted from XXXX to XXXX I extended the payment plan so the payment would be XXXX Over the last 4 months the payment has increased by XXXX so now when faced with a XXXX payment that never seems to decrease the principal balance I refinanced the loan with XXXX It took me 2 years to repair the credit reporting mistakes that Navient made to the reporting bureaus else I would have left them long ago This is exactly the type of loan program that caused the mortgage meltdown and needs to have corrective and significant action so that other borrowers are not treated like I was and they do not experience the financial hardship of ever increasing debt 
I applied for two Private Student Loans with XXXX using a co signer XXXX was selected because they offered a co signer release after 24 months of on time payments which I even made during my school years I currently have a long time steady job XXXX eventually sold the loans to AES As of this date I have made FOUR years of on time payments on Loan 1 and 2 9 years on Loan 2 For the past 2 years I have attempted to release my co signer on three attempts with negative results During these processes AES has requested more and more information all which was what provided to finally forward the information to XXXX the former owner of the loan who ultimately denied the request due to date of application being signed over 60 days Another application was submitted with a quick DENIED AES Customer Services representatives all have different answers and some cant even provide resolutions AES agreed that they bought the loan from XXXX and own it however are not allowed to remove the co signer and said everything had to go through XXXX XXXX My co signer went to XXXX XXXX in XXXX CA in person and spoke to XXXX XXXX a banking officer who was also given the run around by XXXX student loans Our information was not in their system because they sold the loan to AES and we were told to direct our questions to AES which didnt make sense because I received correspondence from XXXX during the XX XX XXXX co signer release application After receiving a non descript denial notice in XX XX XXXX XXXX eventually informed me that a third party XXXX XXXX XXXX denied the request due to credit XXXX The AES agent XXXX XXXX did not provide any additional information other than XXXX didnt feel I could make the payments Even after FOUR YEARS of on time payments and having a long time steady job How is XXXX a third party involved in the final say when XXXX via AES advertised a co signer release after 24 months of on time payments When asking AES agent in XX XX XXXX XXXX employee number XXXX for more information she told me to fax AES a letter requesting XXXX the credit score requirements to release the co signer However a subsequent phone call to AES agent XXXX XXXX said I was not able to do such a thing and didnt have any contact information for XXXX I called XXXX via a XXXX search and was told to direct my questions to AES as they were the service provider Bottom line I established a contract with XXXX based on the co signer release incentive The loan was transferred to AES with the same agreement and NO other stipulations After making the double the aforementioned agreement AES has not released my co signer and continues to give me double speak and not fulfilling the agreement I am requesting my co signer be released as I have kept my side of the agreement per the initial student loan conditions 
Hello I just submitted a separate complaint with Wells Fargo Dealer Services regarding collections harassment tactics This complaint is in regards to Wells Fargo denying me access to my auto loan account When Logging in to my Wells Fargo account My Auto Loan stopped showing up in my accounts I have n t had a way to view my account how much I have paid paid down none of my pay history shows up and I have n t been able to submit bill pay in over a month because there is no longer an account number to send the payments to I was n t sure what to think of this new problem with Wells Fargo until they sent someone to my house at after XXXX last night That issue is part of another complaint because the person they sent threatened legal action and physical harassment All of these illegal actions Wells Fargo is committing against me have me super confused stressed out beyond my ability to control and has been mentally and emotionally damaging This is really bad for my health I truly believe this is retaliation Wells Fargo is doing to me I can see why they denied me the ability to pay to review all my payments and why no one at Wells Fargo understand what I am talking about Its seems pretty convenient for Wells Fargo to completely deny me access to my auto loan account for so long so that they can attempt to repossess my vehicle without even sending me documentation not even a letter NOIA nothing The Person they sent to my home late last night did not even have any information provide me no order nothing After he threatened me verbally and physically I started to dial XXXX at which point he left It was n t as easy as that and more details of that incident are in my other complaint I thought it was relevant to bring up in this complaint XXXX I whole heartedly believe this is retaliation for my last two complaints of Wells Fargo their discrimination and then violating my rights as a consumer by calling me while I have a Cease Desist on file It all makes sense They stopped sending me mail denied me access to my auto loan account I do not know what else to believe I do believe that I made myself a target of Wells Fargo by complaining This is ridiculous Why has Wells Fargo removed access to my account from me They can not remove my access to my Auto Account is that not illegal Is it an error In addition Wells Fargo stopped sending me mail about 8 months ago I should have known there was an issue when I stopped receiving mail from Wells Fargo but at the same time I had access to my account so at the time it was n t an issue until I logged in and there was no longer an account to review This seems to be another tactic for Wells Fargo to deny customers service and take advantage of someone with or without medical issues Every time I submit a complaint it is n t taken serious and nothing ever happens My first complaint was reviewed by 3rd stage bill collector not someone from compliance or some outside third party investigating I am requesting a full investigation for all complaints and not someone with Wells Fargo it should be someone who has zero ties to Wells Fargo that way it wont be another bias unfair internal investigation I am going to make contact with my state Representative This can not continue to happen My other complaint revolves around legal threats and harassment This is my last complaint it is due time for me to seek legal advice for the continued harassment and denying me access to my account I can log in and all I I can access is my credit card Wells Fargo has denied me access to my Auto Loan Account I have tried to look in to this myself and have called have sent Wells Fargo a message through their website under contact us several times without response I was under the impression Wells Fargo didnt want payments or that my auto loan may have been sold to another lender which would make sense why I would n t see my account but I do n t think that is the case because there is zero evidence that I even had an auto loan at all Even if my loan was sold I should still be able to access my account and review my payments interest rates etc This is why I believe this to be retaliation for my several complaints of Wells Fargo Not sure what type of resolution would be appropriate for this and previous acts of crime against me Just because you deny a consumer access to their accounts does n t give you the right to deny payments especially since I have been a paying customer for the last couple of years now I resent that Wells Fargo is using tactics like this to retaliate against me all because I filed complaints against Wells Fargo I have submitted a screen shot of the accounts page The only account that shows up is my credit card account There is zero trace of my Auto loan account I mean there is nothing No statements nothing as if I never had an auto loan No Documents No Statements Nothing This is hazardous to my already deteriorating health These are things I should not have to deal with as a consumer I ask you please look in to Wells Fargo and review this complaint and my previous complaints with an unbiased fair review I do not think its fair for Wells Fargo to investigate my complaints about them themselves When Wells Fargo investigates themselves nothing is ever resolved and I can expect the same responses that I have previously received I am seeking legal action or advise I do not know enough legally to deal with this matter myself Ive needed my account number for some time now I could n t even sell or trade my car in to provide a payoff amount because no one at Wells Fargo could locate my account and I am unable to look it up because its completely gone All I know is that in XXXX XXXX I was behind on one payment and became due for a second I paid to get it all caught up in full the same month I also continued to make one payment a month and yes it was like a week past the due date but never the less I paid every month once I got it caught up My last payment I made was in XXXX for XXXX now I am due for XXXX and XXXX and have had my ability to pay stripped of me by Wells Fargo when they removed my account and all its documents Something is n t right about all of this Please help Thank you
This compliant is regarding closure of my account without my information SunTrust Bank prohibited me to access to my funds which I needed urgently XXXX XXXX I opened the account after depositing 150 00 in account XXXX I completed direct deposit of 800 00 i account XXXX Deposited multiple amounts in the bank account XXXX A XXXX check of XXXX was deposited XXXX 12000 00 cash was deposited in the account I have been trying to access my account online as well as ATM but it was showing nothing after calling customer support they told me my account was closed for some reasons but they were not aware of the reasons I asked SunTrust to give me my funds since I need to use my money SunTrust declined and told me I will be getting my check in 5 7 working days with explanation why my account was closed I have been told that SunTrust has right to close my account without informing me I have written checks in good faith to use my banking account which is denied to me without any reason I am also having SunTrust Mortgage Account that is in excellent standing 
I have an account with citibank and I mailed a check to XXXX in the amount of 500 00 which was cashed but never received by XXXX This caused problems going through tolls and I incurred fees for this I have contacted citibank and they said that the check was cashed but they are unable to find out who cashed the check So basically the bank lost my money and is refusing to refund it or find out and prove who took it I have submitted every single form the bank has asked for and they are continuing to bury me in more forms They lost my money and refuse to give it back 
Respectable Srs For some time I have been receiving a number of unwanted emails and calls from agencies offering help with my educational loan Given that I have been in financial difficulties and it has been impossible for me to finish paying and after hearing so much about them I decided to return the call to one of the many who contacted me That s how I got it contact with XXXX I was distrustful at first and I was thinking about it but I felt pressured because they said that I needed to act fast before Trump changed the law that Obama had implemented In the end they made me believe that they had some connection with the Department of Education given the advertisements they use and EMails I received They really seemed very legitimate and therefore would be a great opportunity to get my debt forgiven They use the terminology relief and forgiveness to attract and deceive by promising help in erasing or forgiving student debt They started by seeing if I really qualified and after a series of questions I got the surprise that in did I was eligible and that I could benefit by reducing my debt to XXXX The great detail and error of my part was that the only way to pay for this Service was through my bank they told me that there would be 50 00 payments for a year to complete the payment and the result would be XXXX Debt To start the process they charged me 150 00 I continued with the idea that they were working on my case After three months I realized that a debt report appears in my credit to a certain Equitable Acceptance of which I never heard or knew of and who not only damaged my credit but when I called them they were demanding I pay them in full to withdraw the report that s how I knew that they had bought my contract that I did not even sign and which they got from student advisors without my signature because at this point I never visited the page where they told me I had to sign After researching the Internet and calling the Education Dept I found out that not only my loan was still there and that all they did was fill out some documents to consolidate my loan so that I wouldnt have to pay temporarily or pay less but the interests continues accumulating The saddest thing is that when this process could be done for free Student Advisors are charging almost 2000 00 which is still an extreme Ripp off of which I have been a victim as many hundreds of others and for which I ask for the support so that Equitable Acceptance stop charges to my bank account immediately and reimburse me back the 390 00 because they have scammed me I hope with my report to help and encourage others to investigate before falling into the hands of unscrupulous companies that take advantage of the despair and vulnerability of people I am now out of work and it gives me a lot of indignation to have to pay them when they have cheated me vilely by making me believe that they could help me get my debt forgiven If it had not been for that promise it would never have fallen into their hands A milllion thanks in advance 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX before my incident with Chase bank my husband realized that we had been hacked somehow Someone opened an XXXX charge in his name They charged 1 00 then 100 00 and got away with it They were trying to charge another 2600 00 when I received a call from XXXX asking me if I authorized this charge I did not and working with my husband XXXX helped him clear everything up Because of this I proceeded to call all of my credit card companies as well as my bank Chase I personally spoke to all representatives and let them know what happened and to place all my accounts on high Fraud Alert personal and business On Saturday XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a txt from Chase asking me if I authorized a transfer of 4800 00 It gave no account information no information as to who the money was to be transferred to nor a phone number to call if I needed help or thought this was an emergency It simply stated to txt back 1 for yes and 2 for no As soon as I saw the message I promptly txted back 2 for no Since it was later in the day after banking hours and tomorrow was a Sunday and I was traveling in Wisconsin at the time I had to wait till Monday to check my accounts Since I had called everyone and spoke to them personally as well as txting back 2 for no I felt that I was safe and protected I was given no further instructions from Chase with the original txt nor received any other txt messages concerning this On Monday morning XXXX XXXX XXXX I opened one of my chase accounts and saw that in fact Chase had transferred with XXXX Quick pay the 4800 00 NOTE I did not have XXXX Quick Pay set up on my account It stated that Chase transferred 4800 00 to a XXXX XXXX As well at the same time someone by the name of XXXX XXXX was asking Chase to transfer another 4800 00 via XXXX Quick Pay to them via another Business account I have with Chase They did not let that go through I did not receive a txt about that the transfer was blocked by Chase and was cancelled on XXXX XXXX XXXX As of XXXX XXXX XXXX Chase has not refunded my money to me I have filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department a fraud report with Chase an FBI report and now a report with you the CFPB According to Chase they have it being reviewed with their Fraud Department expedited Again as of XXXX XXXX XXXX I have not received my funds back I would like to stress that I did everything possible to let Chase know we were having problems I personally spoke to a representative at my branch to let them know I did not have XXXX Quick pay on my account nor do I have a history of using XXXX XXXX Pay with that account And most importantly I txted back 2 for no Again given no further instructions from Chase I thought I was protected Chase appears to be making no efforts to return my money

I took out a loan with this company Mariner finance Shortly after my student loans kicked in and I was n t able to afford the payments for this loan I contacted a debt relief company to help me manage my loans I had and get them paid off Mariner would not work with them not even talk to them They filed a judgement against me I contacted the branch and was told to send my paystub and their lawyers would review it and my current debts to establish an acceptable payment I did n t hear from the branch for weeks and I kept calling for the same representative Now they have put a bank levy on my account and I have no access to my bank at all and I ca n t get a hold of the person who told me to send my paystub for review as I was trying to make arrangements I could afford 
To CFPB XX XX XXXX My name is XXXX XXXX and I am filing a complaint against Wells Fargo Bank for not paying me my part of the settlement for the unauthorized opening of two savings accounts in my name including unauthorized changes to my checking account including an unauthorize transfer of 4 00 from my checking to one of the unauthorized savings account ending in XXXX I had an established checking XXXX since XX XX XXXX and a savings account XXXX since XX XX XXXX The savings account was a recurring saving account for the transfer of 25 00 each month into that account from my social security benefits prior to the unauthorized use of my accounts by bank manager XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX XX XXXX I met XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX CO branch location store number XXXX where I opened a new checking account I specifically requested to XXXX XXXX not to add or change anything to my account and that she should only change the number on my checking account and to leave my savings as it was We did not discuss anything about opening new saving accounts nor did we discuss anything about making any changes to my checking except getting a new number I signed the document with the understanding from XXXX XXXX that I was only signing up for a new checking and nothing more I trusted XXXX XXXX that she was signing me up for a checking account only and nothing more I did not read the find printing on the document that I signed but I never suspected that XXXX XXXX was deceiving me in anyway so I signed the form believing that I had just signed up for a new checking account number only When I left the bank I didnt think anything was wrong or out of the ordinary until a couple of days later when I discovered that there was something different about my accounts so I called the Wells Fargo Phone Bank about my concerns I explained to customer care that I did not authorize any changes to my account and I have no idea what I was looking at on my account I told the customer care rep that I was going to call XXXX XXXX about the matter but before I could call her I received a fee of 5 00 on one of the unauthorized savings account on XX XX XXXX Note I was aware of the hold that XXXX XXXX put on the closed checking account ending in XXXX for pending or future transactions before she closed the account permanently I believe that the overdraft fee occurred because when XXXX XXXX illegally opened the 25 00 savings account without my permission I was told by a phone representative that it required a minimum of 300 00 which XXXX XXXX obviously did not receive from me or I had to have a recurring savings account The account required a minimum of a 300 00 balance which I would not have known about because this was not discussed with me by XXXX XXXX nor I did authorize this When the following month arrived and the minimum balance wasnt in the account I was charged a fee of 5 00 I originally thought and told the bank representative I was being charged a 1 00 25 00 and another 5 00 fee because I did not understand what I was looking at or what the unauthorized accounts were about XXXX XXXX without my permission transferred 4 00 into one of the unauthorized opened savings account and then set up an authorized debit card overdraft service that was not authorized by me I also learned later that she set up my saving account ending in XXXX so that I couldnt make transfers which I later restored I am XXXX and I receive a social security check of 770 00 each month directly to my checking account I have no money that will ever support having two or three savings accounts at one time nor did I authorize this I had an established savings account XXXX before XXXX XXXX added the other two unauthorized saving accounts On XX XX XXXX when I discovered that I was charged a fee I contacted the bank about the two new saving accounts opened in my name without my authorization by XXXX XXXX She opened a Way2Save savings account XXXX that required a minimum of a 300 00 balance and a 1 00 savings account XXXX This was my second call about the matter and the date both unauthorized accounts were closed After explaining the situation to three different bank representatives about how I felt I was bamboozled and tricked into signing those unauthorized savings accounts one of them phoned the bank location in XXXX CO to speak with XXXX XXXX about the matter but the representative said that XXXX XXXX refused to discuss the matter with her The bank representative assured me that she will file a report on my behalf and that someone should get back to me about the matter but they did not until I received an email from Wells Fargo concerning the settlement on XX XX XXXX that stated that if my checking saving or line of credit was opened without my permission I should reply to the email in which I did I replied to the email and waited to hear back from the bank When I did not get a reply I entered the bank at the XXXX CO location approximately two weeks ago and inquired about the settlement On XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a phone call from a bank representative XXXX XXXX who I believe during our conversation wanted to relitigate my complaint which made me uncomfortable since I thought the issue was already settled as far as payment to me for the unauthorized opened accounts On XX XX XXXX I spoke to XXXX and XXXX in the XXXX Branch of the bank who questioned me again about my accounts of what took place and why I felt I was affected by what XXXX XXXX did XXXX informed me that the 85 00 dollars that XXXX said was for part of the settlement was actually an error on the bank and not free money concerning the settlement XXXX told me that my case was closed as far as XXXX was concerned so I told him that I will file a complaint about this matter Wells Fargo owe me settlement money for the unauthorized opened savings accounts that were made by XXXX XXXX in my name including the unauthorize transactions she made Wells Fargo promised its customers that they would take care of whomever were affected by these unauthorized opened accounts but instead they want to relitigate the matter with me so they dont have to pay or take responsibility for the unauthorized accounts XXXX XXXX opened in my name nor hold XXXX XXXX accountable for her own actions On XX XX XXXX Wells Fargo were made aware of my concerns against XXXX XXXX and the unauthorized opened accounts she opened in my name without my permission and I believe that they are now reneging on their agreement to settle this matter with me Wells Fargo still owe me a portion of the settlement for the unauthorized accounts opened without my permission and I want to be compensated I can be contacted concerning this matter at XXXX or email me at XXXX Sincerely XXXX XXXX
I called on XXXX XXXX 2017 to inquire about switching to an income based repayment program with a lower monthly payments I was told to submit my application that the following month XX XX XXXX payment due XX XX XXXX I would be unenrolled from current repayment plan and have a one time 5 00 payment That this one month would not count towards my 120 payments for PSLF but that the new repayment plane would take affect in XX XX XXXX due XX XX XXXX I called XX XX XXXX to inquire about the status as my payment would bill XX XX XXXX and was told my app was flagged for a 15 day manual review but that I should ignore the initial bill and would still pay the one time 5 00 payment on XX XX XXXX I called on XX XX XXXX to follow up and was now told that the 5 00 payment would not be until following moth and that my bill was still 420 00 I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told my request had not been processed that I did not have to make the 420 00 payment due XX XX XXXX but that neither the XX XX XXXX payment nor the 5 00 payment that would now be due on XX XX XXXX would count toward my PSLF The supervisor I spoke to today XX XX XXXX is XXXX XXXX This company is not informing federal loan borrowers properly about their repayment options or the process for switching payments They have caused an unnecessary delay and issue with my account 
I filed for bankruptcy back in XX XX XXXX and cashnet usa was notified of such yet I get an email last week saying they sold my loan to a collection agency and of course now this is on my credit too collection record I emailed and advised cashnet USA that it is against the law to continuing trying to collect on something that was included in bankruptcy and they needed to pull my account from the collection agency and stop all collection efforts but it still has n t been done They continue calling me trying to collect 
i closed my checking account XXXX in person at the branch in XXXX MA 2 weeks later the account was reopened due to a payment being debited to a XXXX XXXX credit card that was attached to the account There is absolutely no way that an account should have been reopened because of this If anything I would owe a late payment to XXXX XXXX Santander Bank has no right to be paying my bills from an account that I closed This is fraud The representative on the phone told me that even though an account is closed Santander Bank has an obligation to pay any bills attached to it It s not Santander s obligation to pay my bills If anything i would have to deal with the issue with the debiting bank It should be noted that the representative specifically stated that the account was reopened With all of the sales practice concerns and inappropriate account openings occurring at large financial institutions i know this is a buzzword for the industry 
I have been on the phone this morning XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX for 1 hour 13 minutes Have spoken to a XXXX then transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX where she put me on hold a few times this most recent time for 15 minutes when I asked to speak to her manager or supervisor and then she disconnected me XXXX told me that an outstanding balance is still showing due for the return of my second key on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I traded in for an XXXX XXXX XXXX back in XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have gone over this with the circuitous XXXX XXXX departments ad nauseam last year and thought that it was FINALLY resolved All of a sudden these past few weeks I ve been getting phone calls and letters from XXXX XXXX stating the key was never returned and I still owe 400 00 Here is my record of actions taken XXXX XXXX XXXX traded in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for an XXXX XXXX XXXX with salesperson XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Gave him one key for which he gave me a receipt without a signature from his manager because he told me his manager was unavailable and it did n t matter anyway I said I d return the next day with the second key XXXX XXXX XXXX returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and handed second key to XXXX XXXX for which he issued me a revised receipt signed by the manager He merely took his copy of the original receipt and changed the 1 to a 2 I insisted on waiting for his manager to sign this one which he made me wait about half an hour to get done Within a week I started seeing outstanding charges in my online account and began making phone calls to XXXX XXXX to inquire XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX told me my online account had n t been updated yet and not to worry my account would be updated to reflect proper credit once XXXX XXXX XXXX paperwork was logged in She told me to allow 24 hours to check my online account again XXXX XXXX XXXX My online account still showing outstanding charges I attempted to call XXXX XXXX again and was kept on hold for 11 minuted 9 seconds and had to hang up to attend to my business XXXX XXXX XXXX I called XXXX XXXX again and spoke to XXXX who told me there was n t any paperwork from XXXX XXXX XXXX with the agreement to cover my first two payments however my account did show that 2 keys were returned I then asked for my issue to be escalated to find out why I was getting different information about my account I was then transferred to XXXX XXXX in the Loyalty Department who told me there was no dealership activity on my account and suggested I wait 72 hours to see if my online account had been updated with the correct credits I asked to speak to someone else that could give me more definitive information She suggested I call XXXX XXXX XXXX and speak to their sales manager XXXX XXXX XXXX I spoke to XXXX Sales Manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX who told me he was aware of who I was and my situation and he would speak with XXXX to ask her to resend my paperwork agreement to XXXX XXXX through their dealership portal He told me he d call me back within an hour to confirm it had been done He never called me back XXXX XXXX XXXX Spoke to XXXX then XXXX then XXXX trying to get to the bottom of the situation but could n t get any resolution Everyone told me different information XXXX XXXX XXXX My online account was still showing outstanding monies due I called XXXX and spoke to XXXX who told me the online account would n t be updated that quickly and I needed to wait another 7 10 days XXXX XXXX XXXX The last person I spoke to on XXXX XXXX XXXX was XXXX ID XXXX phone number XXXX who assured me the issue of my first two months being paid for was resolved and those charges removed from my account which I confirmed online and the receipt for the second key was received and the key charge would be removed although it might take a few days to show up online I checked my online account a week later and all outstanding charges were removed and it seemed as though the account was FINALLY in order I had n t received any communication any notification that any monies were due until about a month ago XXXX when I received my first letter from XXXX XXXX and then the phone calls started stated they needed to speak to me You can then jump to the beginning of my complaint to when I initiated my call to XXXX XXXX inquiring as to the collection There were a series of serious issues I had with this dealership and needed to resolve One issue was that the finance person XXXX XXXX added a roadside service to my new lease which I never approved when he asked me a handful of times each time discounting the price I had n t realized he added the service anyway until I got home and reviewed the lease agreement more carefully At the time of signing at the dealership he was verbally stating the charges and just turning his computer screen for me to digitally sign on the line without seeing what I was signing I realize what a big mistake that was when I got home and is the reason I decided to sit down and read the contract more carefully and noticed the erroneous charge I was also promised in my trade in deal with XXXX XXXX and verbally approved to me by his manager that the payment for the first two months of my new lease would be waived That promise was ignored and took numerous calls and ultimately required that my partner physically go to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and speak very loudly in the showroom so that other customers could hear how unfairly we had been treated so that the manager would come to speak to him and follow through on issuing the proper paperwork to XXXX XXXX stating the agreed upon terms That issue with great time and effort on my part appears to be resolved although now it seems the return of the second key is still being questioned The series of phone calls I listed above were regarding both the 2 month payment credits AND the return of the key credit Attached are the two key returned receipts from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which I provided over a year ago as well

On XXXX 300 00 was withdrawn from our account with a debit card number to XXXX not authorized by my husband or I 300 00 for a wire transfer 9 00 service charge We have never used XXXX XXXX before We immediately called Chase XXXX to report these as fraudulent They opened a claim and put the funds back into our account after 24 hours About a month later the charge reappeared as a Reversal in the same dollar amount Again we called Chase XXXX who informed us that XXXX XXXX told them it was a legitimate charge Debit card address and my husband s name entered as payment info No PIN was entered The debit card was never lost it was in my husband s possession so he was not negligent by not reporting it stolen The Chase fraud representative supplied me with the IP address the name of the person the wire transfer was sent to XXXX someone out of state incarcerated in a correctional facility and the email address the purchaser used with her first and last name Clearly a fraudulent issue Chase said they would give us our money back because XXXX XXXX said it was not fraud and would not pay Chase for this charge They told me to contact XXXX XXXX and were rude to me and would not acknowledge it was fraudulent I asked Chase if they would return our funds if we filed a police report and the police determined it to be fraudulent upon investigation Chase said they would not They said even though it was illegal and fraudulent because XXXX XXXX claimed it was not because they did n t want to pay Chase they would not reimburse us How is this fraud protection My husband and I discussed and decided we would file a police report The IP address the Chase representative provided me for the fraudulent transaction did not have periods in it just numerical digits so I realized I would have to call the Chase Fraud rep back and get the IP address with the periods in it so that I could provide to the police When I called back I was transferred several times and the rep I finally spoke with said she did n t see ANY of this information She forwarded my request on to the allegedly correct department and we have not heard back with this information 
I cosigned a loan 10 years ago for my cousin XXXX XXXX I believe it was a private loan I called XXXX XXXX they sent me to their collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX I spoke to a rep named XXXX and explained the situation and told me he was authorized to settle the account in full The amount owed was 8400 00 full settlement amount was 4300 00 I told him I could pay with a credit card but I needed receipts and a letter showing that the amount was paid in full I received letters stating exactly that I reviewed my credit report and XXXX had not updated my settlement They reported to the credit agency that I was not paid in full It shows a balance of over 5000 00 I have the letters sent ny XXXX XXXX XXXX stating I am paid in full but XXXX is not honoring the settlement and has reported to the credit bureau s that I still owe money on the account My cousin has disappeared no one in the family know his whereabouts I m trying to settle this in good faith I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX XXXX on XX XX XXXX when I questioned why is there a balance still showing on my credit report she tried to extract the rest of the balance from me and I told her I already settled She continued to say that I owed the difference I then told her that I m calling the dept of Education and the dept of Consumer Affairs she changed the whole script she then told me that my account was closed with a XXXX balance 
On XXXX XXXX 2017 I signed in to my Great Lakes account to make a payment for the month of XXXX Because it was after XXXX XXXX my account had fallen past due I made a payment for the full amount owed for that month which was just under 500 00 and my account still remained past due It did not have any information supporting that a payment was made and was being processed Instead it said please make a payment for your past due account I decided to wait until the following day to see if my account status changed The next day the website still said your account is past due please make a payment I checked with my bank and no charge was initiated or pending so I believed the first payment had not gone through The website should have stated payment processing or payment received or anything to indicate that while the account may still be in a past due status a payment for XXXX was no longer owed as this one was being processed Instead it was misleading and asking for an XXXX payment As such I made a second payment of almost 500 00 for XXXX only to realize days later that both payments went through Great Lakes stated that I would need to wait a week for the payment to fully process and then could request a refund which would take about 45 days I believe their website is intentionally set up that way to mislead people into making additional payments when they are not necessary I feel cheated out of an additional 500 00 that I had not budgeted for this month Great Lakes made no acknowledgment of the unreliableness of their website and I do not believe they will make any changes to make their payment collection more simple and less misleading for those who are trying to pay back their loans I logged back in today two days later and my account still says I owe a payment for XXXX 
I am an HSBC customer with a personal checking account savings account and credit card connected to the account At the end of XXXX my account was hacked monies withdrawn and paid to bogus vendors the vendor name was one I have in my files but there was no information on where the funds were transferred to and no record of the transaction The real vendors did not receive any of these funds When the balance of my account was drained the culprit then started to use the credit line on my credit card transferring monies into the account to be fraudulently transferred out It took a lot of wrangling and almost two weeks from the time I discovered it to get HSBC to refund the monies to make my account whole and generate a letter to explain the bounced check from my account The transactions were suspicious to begin with but they did not notice it at all In filing all the paperwork to report the fraud one step I was told to take was to report it to the local police I went to the police precinct and was told they need a report from the bank in order to investigate I have not been able to get such a report from them which seems to me would be routine I ve made multiple phone calls to the XXXX headquarters fraud dept and was told to see the manager at my branch who tells me she has nothing to do with that part of the process and ca n t help While I have been repaid it is an outrage that this bank ca n t or wo n t or does n t have to file such a report I am sure I am not their only customer who has been hacked unfortunately it s now a common practice In order to trace these kinds of activities investigators need such information but HSBC refuses to give it I would appreciate any help you can offer and urge you to ensure that HSBC follows the regulations If there are no regulations that would mandate that they file such a report there should be and I would like to know that as well as I will be happy to start writing letters etc to change the rule

My Bank of America checking account was overdrawn by 150 00 I deposited a check on Thursday XX XX XXXX in the amount of 3000 00 to cover the overdraft I also made an online payment that evening for 2400 00 Typically the availability of funds allows 300 00 to be available immediately and the remaining amount of the deposit of a local check up to 5000 00 to be available the next business day I expected nothing different on this occasion I made the deposit at a Bank of America ATM before XXXX EDT In the process of making the deposit I did not receive any special alerts of any kind I did not pay any attention to the receipt I just put it in my pocket Later that evening I checked my account online and realized that a ten 10 day hold had been put on the check I deposited I called bank of America customer service and was told that the system automatically put a RISK hold on the account and that no person could remove that The customer service person did not know exactly why On Friday XX XX XXXX I deposited an additional 2000 00 in cash into that checking account so my balance was now at 4800 00 An online debit that I had initiated on Thursday XX XX XXXX for 2400 00 hit my bank on Friday XX XX XXXX and the item was returned and a 35 00 NSF fee was charged to my account I called Bank of America again on Saturday XX XX XXXX and spoke to XXXX from WV and then his supervisor XXXX They both echoed that no one at the bank could remove this ten 10 day hold XXXX further advised that the notice I received on my receipt AFTER the ATM deposit was made was all that the bank was legally required to do to inform me of the hold I reminded XXXX that if I was in the branch a live teller would have let me know of the extended hold before I deposited the item therefore allowing me to decide if to deposit the check at this bank or not I pointed out that the ATM gave me no such alert during the ATM deposit process and therefore I needed to have the situation addressed and resolved I advised her that for such a large bank with over thirty 30 million customers this was an unacceptable situation and asked to speak to her manager She confirmed that nothing could be done by ANYONE in the bank and apologized for the INCONVENIENCE It is unacceptable that of the thousands of banks and credit unions in this country one of the 4 XXXX dollar banks in the USA with ten of millions of customers could have automated electronic protocols that are completely insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of live human beings This needs to be resolved

Dear Sir or Madam Back in XXXX when my wife and I were trying to receive XXXX gift from our families abroad to put a down payment for our first home purchase our family in XXXX used a money exchange company to send the money to our Bank of America account It looks due to the XXXX sanctions the money transfer company did not use the global wire or swift system and instead did it through bartering After noticing some cash deposits in our account Bank of America called us and asked if we know the people who made those deposits We told the story and gave them full authority to investigate the case and if needed return the money to the people On XXXX XXXX we both received letters from Bank of America saying they have decided to close our accounts We asked for the reason but was told the bank has the rights to end her business with us anytime they want and is not obliged to give us the reason We accept that but asked BoA to give us any kind of documents or evidence of blocking that XXXX so our parents back in XXXX can take the money exchange company to curt and ask for the refund Since then we have not received any update or answer from Bank of America They simply ignore us and despite calling more than XXXX times to people who we are told are working on our case we have not heard a word BoA even kept the sum of XXXX in my wife s saving account which has had nothing to do with that disputed deposits It is so frustrating to see that how Bank of America instead of treating us as victims incriminating us most likely profiling us because our relations to XXXX and treating us with ultimate ignorance And all of this has happened after we both were loyal costumers of BoA for more that 5 years and have got excellent records with them

I have been working with Fed Loan to certify my income for an income based repayment plan since XXXX After having to submit multiple applications with different supporting information to verify my income and employment I was told that my monthly loan payment would go from 200 00 per month to 450 00 per month I could n t afford the extra monthly payment so I immediately contacted Fed Loan to request a lower payment amount and I ve been dealing with that issue since XXXX I uploaded my application to change payment plans to their online document server on XXXX XXXX My previous repayment plan ended XXXX XXXX and then starting in XXXX I was supposed to owe 450 00 Since I still had n t heard anything from Fed Loan about the status of my request I called customer service on XXXX XXXX and asked what I was supposed to do about my payment I was told to not make the 450 00 payment that my account says I owed but to instead wait until XXXX pay a 5 00 skip payment fee and then my new payment plan would begin Just to be safe I requested that they put my loans in forbearance for the last 10 days of XXXX so my account would n t be marked delinquent I waited through XXXX but my account never showed the 5 00 payment I spoke with an employee via chat on XXXX XXXX and was very clearly told that I should NOT make the XXXX payment but wait until XXXX XXXX then pay 5 00 even though that was n t the amount I was told was due She told me that 5 00 would bring my account current and then they would process my request to change payment plans I submitted my initial request in XXXX and they still had n t processed my paperwork 4 months later I did as I was instructed and early in XXXX my account was still showing the past due amount for XXXX I called customer service on XXXX XXXX to ask about this I was told that they were still processing my application and to call back in another 2 3 weeks if I had n t heard anything I was promised that my account would be returned to good standing once I was switched to a different repayment plan I received notification my repayment plan change on XXXX XXXX and told that my new payment amount would begin for my payment due XXXX XXXX My loans are currently in forbearance for XXXX but my account still shows I owe the XXXX payment I chatted with someone today XXXX XXXX and was told that I was given incorrect information about my XXXX payment during my chat conversation on XXXX XXXX The person I chatted with today told me that he put in a request for an administrative forbearance to cover the XXXX payment but that would take 15 20 days to process He assured me that if I make my XXXX payment in full and on time it would still count toward my qualifying payments for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In the meantime I was instructed by a Fed Loan representative to continue to let my account remain delinquent I tried to clarify some final details at the end of our conversation but the representative I was speaking to stopped responding to my questions After 15 minutes without a response from him to repeated chats I sent I disconnected 
On XX XX XXXX2017 I called Navient my student loans provider to talk with them about my approximate monthly payment and the options for lowering my monthly payment once my grace period ends in XXXX My family and I just moved from XXXX XXXX county in XXXX upon our completion of school to XXXX XXXX because we could no longer afford our bills rent etc We had accumulated in 8500 00 in credit card debt just to survive We ve moved in with my family and are essentially homeless We can not afford my 590 00 payment for my private loans on top of the payments for my husband and my federal loans I was told there are not really any long term solutions to help me despite the fact we ca n t even afford a home to live in with our XXXX XXXX The lady I spoke to was not accommodating to our situation and made it clear that I could not be helped with anything until XXXX XXXX 2017 Simply I can not afford my private student loans to Navient and still be able to put food on the table for my family 
In XX XX XXXX I defaulted on my student loan because of illness which caused me to take early XXXX retirement Over the next two years and after many many harassing phone calls I came to an agreement with a collection company called XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of XXXX XXXX to start a repayment plan Although I was only receiving about 700 00 a month in XXXX payments they tried to force me into paying 300 00 per month but I would not relent because I would not have had enough left to pay my house payment pay other bills and to live on After a 30 minute conversation with the representative I offered to pay back 120 00 per month and she very reluctantly agreed Although there was never an agreement writing I had agreed to pay faithfully which I have done up until this month My account number is XXXX There was no payment book There are no monthly invoices that are sent to me and they do not got give any kind of updates unless you call and request one I was told by the representative that if I ever missed one payment the agreement would be broken and that her agency would take legal steps to recover the full amount due So in XX XX XXXX I started my payments by paying a one half payment of 62 00 and in XX XX XXXX I stared paying full payments of XXXX have never missed a payment At that time I was dending my payments to an address in Kansas I do not have or recall that particular address Sometime in XX XX XXXX I received a phone call from someone who said she represented a company called XXXX XXXX and told me that my loan account was transferred to them and that I should start sending my payments to them I was to send the payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Missouri I continued to send payments During all of these years I had never received any letters that showed that I was behind on my payments Then in XX XX XXXX the payment I sent them was returned to me On the outside of the envelope ther was a postal stamp tthat read Addressee Unknown I was bewildered and confused because I did not understand why the payment was returned I called the telephone of the office which is XXXX and spoke to person about why my payment was returned He told me that the office where I had been sending my payments had closed and that a company called XXXX in Ohio had taken over my account I was again shocked and bewildered because I had never received any kind of notification that my account had been transferred again I called the XXXX office to make try and get some information about my account but the lady I spoke to said that she could not discuss my account with me because you live in Arizona She went on to say that she could answer any questions and she could not give me anymore information When I got off the phone I really did not know what to do After pondering this whole dilemma I got on the computer and looked up Integrity Solutions and found a site that referred me to a company called Navient There was information there that said that Navient was the collection agency for XXXX XXXX so I returned the XX XX XXXX check and mailed it to the Navient address hoping that would resolve the issue of where I was suppose to send my payments The check was cashed by Navient on XX XX XXXX Then I sent in my XX XX XXXX payment to the same address On Thursday XX XX XXXX the check had been returned to me I the form of a government issued treasury check with a notation on the bottom stub that read This Refund Is Being Sent Due To XXXX XXXX XXXX Send to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX Effective date XX XX XXXX A telephone number on the check stub reads XXXX I called that number and a representative said that I need to call an office named Post Claims Assistance Department That number is XXXX On Friday afternoon around XXXX XXXX I called that number abd spoke to a supervisor named XXXX She said that she saw my account but her office awas nor handling my account and gave me another number to call but before we disconnected she gave me a lot of very confusing information about my account Most of the information had to do with how my account had been sent in circles and that she had no ides had or why my account had been handled the way it has been way it One outstanding point she made while we were discussing my account was that my account showed that I was missing sevral payments I was horrified because I know that I have never missed a payment The most outstanding payments she told me about were the ones missing for XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX I told her that did not make sense because I was told that if I ever missed a payment that XXXX XXXX or its representative would come after me I told her that there was no way I could or would have missed payments so soon after the XX XX XXXX agreement Anyway she said she could not respond to that because she could only talk about what she saw on my account She suggested that I do my own research by contacting the bank that the checks were presented to and to get copies of all the checks that were cashed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Navient On this day I received a call from my son who s name is on thre loan as a cosigner He said that he is being harassed about the loans I do not understand why they have not called me or sent me a letter or something about all of this I would like for them to stop harassing my son whose name is XXXX XXXX He lives at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Arizona XXXX It seems to me that the collection agencies that XXXX XXXX uses to collect payments are trying to set me up for failure in order to come after my property I really would like for someone to help me resolve this mess I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and am in declining documented health My mental and physical health have been greatly effected by XXXX XXXX s behavior and I ca n t take much more of this Please help 1 Sincerly yXXXX XXXX 
My original loan amount for all three loans was 160000 00 I had some trouble paying regularly initially in XXXX I paid but missed some payments and some were late In XXXX I set up an automatic debit from my bank of approximately 1700 month I have made every payment since then on time I currently still owe 240000 00 and wo n t have it paid off until XXXX if I live that long The total amount I will have paid off if I live long enough to pay this back will 410000 00 What s more I can not deduct any of the interest that I pay on these loans unlike my mortgage My loans were originally held by XXXX XXXX and I consolidated them through them but they are now owned by Navient I was told when I consolidated them that I could only do it once The amount of money I pay per month is a significant amount of my take home income more than my monthly mortgage payment 
I applied for a loan and was approved for 200 00 Before I accepted I looked at the payment amounts how many months and interest rate They had XXXX options 58 00 13 months 54 00 20 months And 53 00 26 months All with an interest rate of 697 This company should be shut down and all current loans should be forgiven This is highway robbery at it s finest and should not be allowed 
On XXXX XXXX 2017 I sent a certified letter to GM Financial for account XXXX under XXXX and XXXX XXXX in regards to verifying an additional fee added to our bill in relation to a debt collector by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The certified letter requested validation under the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act to provide evidence bearing my signature from debt collection which GM Financial decided to pay without validation and is now charging me for it GM Financial stating that fee is valid due to an itemized statement from debt collector which is not a legal documentation without a signature 
Every year I recertify my loans for income based repayments This year I filled out the form as usual The form is the same form that has been online with FedLoan I submitted it promptly and received a rejection one month later When I called to find out why FedLoan said that the form I filled out was no longer the form they were using despite the date in the top right hand corner stating that the form was valid They told me to fill out a new form I did this and submitted it Again a month or more later they sent back a rejection saying that they did n t have my income taxes I explained that they were already submitted Six hours and multiple phone calls later they admitted they did have the income taxes I told them I was nervous with the processing time as my new payment that was not income based would take effect and that I could not afford to pay it They told me there was nothing to be done and I would have to forbear if I could n t afford my payments until they processed the request I explained that was n t fair as I submitted the correct information TWICE and they rejected it I was forced to forebear for two months Not only is the interest compounded but I lost out on two months of loan forgiveness causing me to have to work in the public sector for two months longer I called to complain about this Numerous transfers and promises that someone would call me back they did not It has been two months since they promised to call me back about the forbearance I have made so many phone calls and waited for people to help It has n t happened

The complaint at its core is the loan was charged off and closed prior to receiving all insurance monies The vehicle total loss date was XX XX XXXX All payments had previously been made on time or prior to monthly due date of the XXXX up to and including the XX XX XXXX payment I knew everything would be covered by the primary insurance service contract cancellations and GAP payments and communicated this to the finance company multiple times Because of communication issues between the finance company and the primary insurance company the insurance payments were delayed from the very start I had to email the Settlement Summary from the primary insurance to the finance company on XX XX XXXX because they could not communicate and I had to step in It was this same day that I sent the finance company the GAP checklist to obtain GAP benefits OnXX XX XXXX I physically went to the dealership from where I purchased the vehicle to cancel the extended warranty and oil service contracts I found out much later that only the extended warranty was cancelled at this time It took approximately 2 months for the extended warranty cancellation refund to reach the finance company and my account I did not realize until the end of XX XX XXXX that the oil service contract had not been canceled and it seems the finance company had no idea either Once I realized this mistake I physically went back to the dealership to have the oil service canceled even though I have paperwork showing it was cancelled in XX XX XXXX The initial GAP payment was made in early XX XX XXXX The breakdown I received was dated XX XX XXXX In the GAP benefit calculation the original full price of both the extended warranty and the oil service contract are deducted from the initial payment In a page accompanying the breakdown titled Important Questions and Answers an explanation is given as to how a supplemental payment is made to the lender for the used portion of the extended service contracts I highlighted this section in a phone call and email to the finance company both occurring on XX XX XXXX In early XX XX XXXX I received a final bill closing the auto loan account I emailed the finance companyXX XX XXXX to once again highlight the paragraph explaining the supplemental GAP payment to show they were closing the account in error On or just before XX XX XXXX I received a breakdown of the supplemental GAP payment which I immediately emailed to the finance company I then called and spoke to the finance company about the final payment from the GAP policy The GAP company had amended my finance contract to state the finance company would backdate insurance benefit payments to the date of loss as had happened with the previous payments but since the account had been charged off they could no longer backdate the final payment from the GAP company I was told by a supervisor that they were in the process of waving the final balance of 13 00 but that has never occurred

My Coinbase account had verified my XXXX checking account and identity years ago Recently after logging in and moving Bitcoins from my wallet to my vault I tried to move them back to my wallet The transaction has been waiting on approval whatever that means for over a week now I opened a ticket with their support bot six days ago and have only received an email that says they got my request No follow up no contact I found that one of the few things I could do in my Coinbase account was verify my bank account again so I thought maybe since it had been a few years I might have to do that I started that process They verify your account by sending two small sums of money Usually a few cents You then verify your account by verifying the amounts after you get them They say it could take up to three business days to get the amounts It has been four business days since I began that process and I have no small deposits in my account I am frustrated because Coinbase support does not support the customers They do not respond to service tickets 
I have called Navient numerous times to see if they could help lower my monthly pavements and the say they ca n t even though my family has grown and has medical bills making it hard to pay my full monthly payment 
Active hours app is showing that I withdrew 100 00 on XXXX XXXX 2017 to be transferred to my checking account however no money was ever withdrawn and no fund we received in my checking account I have contacted there support group multiple times and have not been able to resolve the last contact was last night I did advise them that they better not try to take this money out of my account when I get paid on XXXX XXXX 2017 since it is not something I ever received I have not received any kind of response from them I am beginning to believe the Activehours app is a scam They have no phone number to call and speak to someone Everything is done through email 
Filed previous complaint and received notice that there was nothing that could be done 
I started a payment plan XXXX 2014 that was supposed to prevent my student loan from going into default They kept asking for large sums of money 7 000 15000 00 to start it changing the amount owed every time I called telling me to ask my extended family asking why my husband was n t helping and even making a comment on me not marrying someone rich enough to pay my loans for me After some back and forth with the XXXX XXXX costumer service I got them to start my plan with just the first payment down which they accidentally double charged us for After a year they called again with the same story as in 2014 I needed to pay X amount now or my loan would default and I needed to go on this plan to stop it After more back and forth with costumer service I got the plan started again This year now year 3 they started calling again this time just to keep payments going I asked them why I never saw my credit report improve after being on the payment plan so long and they informed me my loan has been indefault since 2014 Navient is the collection agency but over the last 3 years they have charged us my mother and I through both Navient and XXXX XXXX My mother and I were told several times in the last 3 years this would prevent default and I am finding out today that they do not offer a program to get you out of default and my only way out is paying off the loan Which is 20000 00 more than when I started and has not gone down at all on this plan due to capitalized interest every year I have tried everything short of getting a lawyer which I ca n t afford to get this under control so I can repair my credit and buy a home My school is closed and discredited and I ca n t consolidate this loan 
On XXXX XXXX of XXXX I took out a 800 00 loan from XXXX In the past I have always paid these loans pack in 1 2 payments so I never understood how the long term payoff process went I started making payments of roughly 140 00 every other week and had been paying this for all of XXXX XXXX and into XXXX On XXXX XXXX I e mailed XXXX after realizing the principle balance on the loan had not gone down After doing research I found out that XXXX is not licensed and does not have to abide by state federal interest guidelines and that the interest on my loan was at least 400 if not more They claim to be licensed by their tribe in North Dakota I asked to be able to pay off the remaining balance of the loan principle 93 00 They refused I have requested this multiple times since XXXX they still refuse They have blocked my account online so the only information I get about the status of my loan is from one loan officer named XXXX XXXX He is now refusing to answer my e mails regarding the situation and stated he will not e mail me further regarding a resolution Any report to my credit or other agencies will be disputed under the fact that tribal law and regulation is being upheld off of tribal land through manipulation etc 
My loan payment was due and paid XX XX XXXX at XXXX Pacific Standard time I recieved a payment confirmation through email and I printed out my recipt I thought that paying a day ahead of time I should be ok right Wrong My account is now passdue because the paynent is supposedly pending It is XXXX XXXX Pacific Standard time and it is still pending I do n t have any banking issues so this sould n t be a problem

I became XXXX on XX XX XXXX and lost my job due to said XXXX in XX XX XXXX I contacted Navient about my private student loan or Signature Student Loan as it is referred to on my account They told me I have no more forbearance and it would go to collections They will offer me no lower payment Since that time I have been receiving 8 collection calls day When I called Navient they said that they know how many times a day they can call and that number is 8 They said they have their own internal collections They do call between the specified times but eight times per day They said they are not harassing me but trying to collect on a debt Although I have been paying on this debt since XX XX XXXX the principal alone is above the principal amount of the original loan The original principal amount was 29000 00 and the payoff amount today is 29000 00 This has caused me to look at the history of my payments I see that I was charged a 920 00 repayment fee at the inception of the loan I have no idea what that is or if it is legit Additionally I do n t see a total of how much I have actually paid already on the payment history It sure seems like they would end up receiving a lot more than the principal amount than a person should have to pay Especially for a student loan P They said they will send me paperwork to complete and if they find that I am permanently XXXX the loan can be forgiven The calls will stop for seven days I asked once before for them to stop calling me because I am XXXX and have no job and they told me I have to request that every 7 days or the calls will continue 
For several years now I have been signed up for the IBR plan for my federal student loans administered through NelNet I used the IBR plan as it both allowed more flexibility in monthly payments and kept interest from capitalizing as long as I was on the plan As my intention was to get the loans paid off in a quick manner I wanted to be as efficient as possible P On XXXX XXXX XXXX I submitted my repayment plan recertification through the Student Loans gov site and received a confirmation email from the site On XXXX XXXX Nelnet sent me an email notifying me that they had received the application and that they would be in touch regarding any needs I believe I mailed in my paper application as instructed by the website on or around XXXX XXXX On XXXX XXXX Nelnet sent an email confirming that my application was in review I received another such email from Nelnet on XXXX XXXX On XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX I received standard communications regarding my account auto debit and a statement available No other communications from Nelnet were received until XXXX XXXX P In the meantime XXXX XXXX XXXX was my last of work As of XXXX XXXX I was working on starting XXXX XXXX XXXX under the understanding that I was on IBR and would be able to continue the lower payments My income therefore dropped to 0 00 P On XXXX XXXX XXXX Nelnet notified me via email that all the accrued interest XXXX just short of 50000 00 was going to capitalize meaning it would be added to the principal amount of the loan and I would be charged interest on it This would make it much harder for me to repay the loans as interest would accrue faster P I called Nelnet on XXXX XXXX and spoke with an associate who explained that because I had missed the deadline of XXXX XXXX to submit my income verification the loan reverted to standard repayment and the interest capitalized He insisted that a letter had been sent on XXXX XXXX informing me of missing information in my application I never received such a letter as evidenced by the dates of communications I did receive outlined above He also told me that Nelnet has an internal processing time of 15 days and so I needed to have my application in by XXXX XXXX in order to have it done in time If I had turned in my application before the deadline but not in enough time for processing I would still have lost my IBR status He let me know that there was no way to undo the capitalization of the interest He did put me on a forbearance so that I could have time to determine my options He then passed me on to a supervisor P The supervisor also noted the existence of a XXXX XXXX letter I emphasized that I never received such a communication I informed the supervisor that it was my belief I had accurately submitted the application and no communication to the contrary was received It was my contention during the phone call that as I had not received any communication regarding anything wrong with my application that some amount of consideration should be extended The supervisor admitted that I was signed up for electronic communications so the email should have gone directly to my email I informed him that no such letter arrived and it was not in my inbox in the folder where I file communications from Nelnet in my spam or trash folders He informed me that there was no way to undo the capitalization and no one with authority in the organization to do so He gave me some options for repayment plans but I was unprepared to commit to any particular plan as I had no time to research my options He said he would send me an application to turn in when I decided what I want to do 
I have a car loan through American credit acceptance for a XXXX XXXX XXXX The vehicle was sold to me in XXXX for approximately 10000 00 The total payments I have made have exceeded that amount but because of the interest and fees caused by late payments the finance company still has my balance at close to 6000 00 On XXXX XXXX XXXX I contacted ACA in regards to the condition of the vehicle I advised at that time that the vehicle is barely in working condition and asked for my options I was told about a settlement offer The agent instructed me to take the vehicle to a mechanic and get an estimate for the needed repairs and to fax it in along with a settlement offer that I think the van is worth The mechanic recommended getting rid of the vehicle as the repairs needed would be well into the 1 000s would n t guarantee a fix and would n t be worth it based on the XXXX XXXX value Based on the mechanics estimate I offered 750 00 which is the trade in value on that vehicle in excellent condition which this van is not On XXXX XXXX XXXX the company received my paperwork by fax The agent I spoke with said the account is put on hold until the settlement is reached My offer would be reviewed and either accepted and a letter will be sent stating that I have 30 days to pay or a counter offer will be sent and if I accept I have 30 days to pay My account was not in repossession status at that time While waiting on the decision from the company the condition of the van worsened making it unsafe to drive On XXXX XXXX XXXX the vehicle was repossessed from in front of my house I contacted the finance company who admitted that the settlement process was not marked on their end as started and although they received my paperwork to start the process it was not started so the account was not put on hold so eventually it went into repossession status The error was with someone in the company not completing the necessary steps to get the settlement started but when I spoke with them they put it on me for not calling back when I was told submit the paperwork and I would be contacted Also they did not accept my offer but raised it to 1000 00 So when I said that was n t how the settlement was supposed to work I was supposed to keep my van get the title and do with it what I pleased and now I have nothing and you still want me to agree to the settlement I was told that s the best they could do even though the van should n t have been repossessed I want this van showed as being paid or settled and no repo on my credit because it should not have been repossessed when the account was on hold and I should n t have to pay the settlement offer if I m not getting my van back

Hi I could not fine a correct category for this complaint it s an odd XXXX I use the XXXX lending servic e Prosper prosper com I am a lender Today I received the following notice Important Account Update It recently came to our attention that the annualize d net return numbers displayed on your account overview page were inaccurate due to a system error This error only affected the Annualized Net Return and Seasoned Annualized Net Return numbers and has now been fixed This error did not impact any other part of your account including payments deposits monthly statements tax documents and note and loan level information including estimated returns Essentially Prosper has for years stated my returns were around 9 however this looks to be an error and my returns are now displayed at around 5 This is just the displayed return not the actual money earned but I made investment decisions based on this number Just like a normal mutual fund the return is the most important metric and for years it looks like it was incorrect and much higher than reality Does not sound good to me and it feels serious enough that I wanted to contact you

I was charged XXXX by The Student Loan Help Center to act as my Limited Power of Attorney in expediting the transfer of my debt from XXXX XXXX My original understanding of what was to transpire and why I was paying them 990 00 was they would be transferring my debt and I would then be paying them back my debt rather than XXXX XXXX Basically refinancing my debt to The Student Loan Help Center Once the process was completed my debt was transferred to XXXX XXXX I started to make my new payments to XXXX XXXX and noticed my principle was not decreasing I called XXXX XXXX and questioned the payment plan and inquired why my principal was n t deceasing Through my conversation with XXXX XXXX I advised the representative I had paid 990 00 to have my debt transferred to them At which point he told me XXXX XXXX would never charge a client to have their debt transferred and no one should be charged money for a service when it comes to federal loans He recommended I reach out to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to attempt to get my money back He also advised not only should I not have been charged but 990 00 was completely unreasonable to have a help center fill out some paper work on your behalf and that XXXX XXXX would not have charged me anything At this point I was shocked and outraged to know that I could have just gone through XXXX XXXX to begin with and not had to pay 990 00 to basically have paperwork completed I ve been through this process before when I refinanced my private loans through XXXX XXXX and they did n t charge me anything to have my debt transferred I was under the impression and the extent of my understanding was that I was paying The Student Loan Help Center to take on my debt and I would be paying them back and that s why there was a charge of 990 00 At no point was this process explained in detail that The Student Loan help center was just a servicer to have my debt transferred to XXXX XXXX If I had known that I would have just contacted XXXX XXXX directly and go through the same process I did when I refinanced my private loans with XXXX XXXX 990 00 is a rip off for such a service and is almost a years worth of payments on my student debt I would understand this charge if The Student Loan Help center was the servicer taking on the responsibility of my debt but that was not the case The Student Loan Help center should have just told me what to do in order to have XXXX XXXX assist me with transferring refinancing my debt and charged me maximum 100 00 for the professional advice

US Bank applies over draft fee s on my account based on the available account balance They calculate the available account balance by subtracting my Debit Card Authorizations from my actual account balance Debit Card Authorizations are defined below When you use your debit card as credit and authorize payment without using your PIN the final charge will be submitted by the merchant and reflected in your Account Balance once complete Meanwhile these transactions appear as Authorization Pending in your pending transactions list Some authorizations may not be shown between XXXX and XXXX Central Time due to processing So this means they are charging me overdraft fee s on pending transactions These pending transactions have not completed and been paid yet They subtract my pending transactions from my balance but not add my pending deposits until they have fully processed I think if they are going to count my pending withdraws against my balance they should also count my pending deposits against my balance as well Thanks XXXX

During XX XX XXXX I XXXX closed my business checking bank account at XXXX and switched to XXXX During XX XX XXXX I called up Citizen One Auto Finance requesting a form to be set up with auto payment through the new bank account I was sent a form to fill out which I did However at the beginning of XX XX XXXX sometime between the XXXX and the XXXX I received a call from Citizen One Auto Finance notifying me that my account is past due I immediately paid the balance and requested again to be set up with auto payment I received another auto payment form which I filled and mailed on XX XX XXXX To my great disappointment and frustration I received another call on XX XX XXXX notifying me again that the account is past due At this point I started to ask questions After spending 6 hours on the phone and speaking with over 10 customer representatives I finally found out that the auto payment request form which was mailed on XX XX XXXX was only received on XX XX XXXX a fact which I find hard to believe Additionally I was informed for the very first time that it takes up to 2 billing cycles for the auto payment to be implemented Had I known this fact I would have continued to send checks until I would see the auto payments coming out of the bank Later on that day I discovered from another representative that both applications were rejected because a letter from my bank specifying that I m a signor on the account was not provided along with the form This requisite was not communicated to me during the 2 phone calls in which I requested the auto payment set up Most importantly this requisite was not listed what so ever on the instructions of the form itself The form does say however that if it is incomplete it would be sent back to me That never happened And when I called for the second time for the auto payment set up no one informed me that my first application was rejected or the reason I feel that Citizen One Auto Finance was being deceitful and was withholding information to gain more late fees and hurt my credit score I had to spend an entire day calling dozens of times and being told at times actual lies to discourage me to file a complaint with their credit bureau in order to discover the real reason the auto payment was not implemented

On XXXX the XXXX of 2016 I made a purchase at a store in the amount of 130 00 for the remainder of that day I did n t make any additional purchases I was contacted by Suntrust bank later that evening because a fraud alert had been issued on my account I spoke with a representative from the fraud department and it was discovered that XXXX was charged on my debit card I realized that I had lost my debit card and it was found and then used without my authorization or consent Suntrust issued a provisional credit but later determined that no error occurred and reverse the decision along with XXXX of NSF to my account I sent an affidavit of fraud disputing the charges They then sent me an additional form asking me to provide more information why they should look further into this matter I sent them a detailed explanation that I did not make the charges I went on further to ask them to look at my previous spending trends as well as the areas in which I normally make purchases The purchases that were made were in stores that I had never previous shopped nor was it in the area in which I live and normally make purchases I suggested that they further investigate by checking surveillance and matching the time of purchases to see if I actually made the purchases I also asked them to compare signatures with my own signatures on receipts as well as the fact that on most occasions I use my pin number to make purchases and they individual individuals had to use a credit in order to make purchases which is n t consistent with the way I normally handle transactions I also suggested if they were to locate the individual individuals who make the said purchases they could not affiliate them with me in any way After all of the information that I gave them to further investigate they still refused to reverse the charges and credit the amount back to my account As a consumer I feel that my rights have been violated and I have unfairly been a victimized and the bank has violated my rights under the Reg E electronic funds transfer act I am reaching out to your organization to help me resolve this matter as soon as possible I am sure millions of other consumers have experience this in regards to banking institutions and it causes extreme stress and anxiety when you have been a victim and feel you have no rights or protections against others who set out to commit fraudulent activities due to lost or stolen debit cards Please assist in the matter if you can Thanks
Please read the two emails below 1 XXXX XXXX XXXX I would like to inform you than I am totally disappointed with the way XXXX XXXX XXXX has treated me because I am an XXXX descent despite the fact that I have banked with you since 2002 and have had two mortgages with you till this day I have never had a problem with your bank until your fraud department decided to close my account last week XXXX because one deposited check of 5000 00 had an irregular signature deposited XXXX and I got notified on XXXX and they deceived me by telling me that the check will be returned in 5 10 business days The other bank soon honored the signature and asked that the check be re presented to XXXX but XXXX told me on the 14th business day XXXX over the phone that my check will not be returned In the notice of XXXX I was given till XXXX to make my account positive which became positive by XXXX less than 2 weeks A day after my account was positive on XXXX Bank of America sent me another notice that my account has been closed I ran to the bank to speak with XXXX who told me that there was nothing he could do because the fraud department closed it due to a business decision He also told me to come into the bank to pay my mortgage which I have NEVER done before because all my payments are made online Also my XXXX XXXX told me today over phone they collected their payments on XXXX but when I went to the bank today I was told that my account was closed XXXX and a check had been sent to me Now I have to go to another bank to pay my mortgage and car note online XXXX should be ashamed of themselves for treating their customer for over a decade with 2 mortgages like a criminal living in poverty who now has to walk in like an illiterate to pay his mortgage in the bank instead of online This was done because I was wiring money to XXXX and I have a XXXX name If I was white with a XXXX name and I was sending money to XXXX I am sure I will be treated differently with some level of respect Please respond Thanks 2 Thanks XXXX I have spoken to XXXX twice in the branch about this on XXXX a day after I first got notified about the irregular signature on the check and on XXXX when the fraud department told me over the phone that the check will not the returned despite the fact that XXXX told me that the check will be returned in 5 10 business days I think the fraud department intentionally set me up to close my account because I am on XXXX descent I spoke to them twice before XXXX and they said I could re present the check when I get it They gave me till XXXX in their XXXX notice to make my account positive and my account was positive on XXXX but they sent me a notice on XXXX a day after my account became positive that my account is closed This is racism and it was done because I am an XXXX descent and was wiring money to XXXX Will they close my account if I was XXXX wiring money to XXXX after my account was made positive Will it take 15 business days to inform me that my check will not be coming back They strategically delayed me to have evidence to close my account despite banking with XXXX XXXX XXXX since 2002 and with 2 mortgagees I now have to go to another bank to pay my XXXX XXXX XXXX mortgage online rather than walk into your bank This is shameful 
Creditor participated in Unfair Deceptive Abusive Acts or practices UDAAP by committing a Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and a Breach of the of Implied Warranty of Merchantability Creditor via merchant provided me with a vehicle backed by a loan which was defective and which had serious mechanical problems and as a result the creditor via its merchants practiced and committed unfair dealings which is a breach of contract and a violation of my consumer rights I was unable to drive the car and had to park it for over a year as the car was not functional They therefore violated FDCPA and state Laws This inputted a high financial burden on me and greatly affected my credit and therefore I will like the violations committed by the creditor to be investigated 
I purchased a timeshare and in 2012 defaulted on the loan due to being laid off I was contacted by XXXX the original creditor and was offered to sell back my timeshare to my understanding at the time I filled out the ppwrk but never received the 200 00 it is now showing on my credit report as a foreclosure I contacted Equaint Financial and was told they do not have the loan or can not service it and was told to contact XXXX XXXX they advised they never serviced my loan it was sold to them by XXXX So they have no knowledge of the opportunity to sell it back My issue is that from my understanding Equaint can not report to the credit bureau for a debt they cant service or own Once I reached out to them they reopened my account and it no longer is saying foreclosure but is saying that it is 120 149 days late How can this be when it was closed for foreclosure 
Our customer transferred by wire On XX XX 2016 to a Wells Fargo account with the beneficiary of our company This was a fraudulent account and we do not have an account with Wells Fargo We believe the account used to receive and launder the funds was one that was set up by their employees which is related to the accounts that were opened up without proper authorization or documentation Wells Fargo clearly did not exercise any caution given the problems they have with the unauthorized accounts At the minimum they should have a matching program that would verify account holder name and number matched and that the account holder has been verified when handling wire transfers

On XX XX XXXX I bought a XXXX Toyota Camry with VIN XXXX FROM XXXX XXXX that Ally financed Initially I made a 3500 00 down payment and the balance was 13000 00 My payment records show that I have paid a total of 5400 00 between XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX This will bring my balance before interest deductions to 7600 00 however my actual account balance at Ally excluding interest stands at 9700 00 What this goes to show is that I have paid a total of 2000 00 in interest according to Ally my APR is 10 75 charges and hidden fees I believe that Ally has either charged me excessive interest or levied hidden fees on my account This is evident in the consistent late charges that Ally imposed on me even though I have paid my monthly payments with the exception of 3 occasions when I defaulted on the due date or within the 7 day grace period I have documentary evidence to show that all the bank payments posted within XXXX business days yet Ally charged me late fees Below are some of the late fees and dates XXXX 16 00 XX XX XXXX 16 00 XX XX XXXX 16 00 XX XX XXXX 32 00 XX XX XXXX XXXX XX XX XXXX 14 00 XX XX XXXX 14 00 XX XX XXXX 14 00 XX XX XXXX 27 00 XX XX XXXX 40 00 Earlier this year and in the last two months I have disputed these charges in letters I wrote to Ally In my letters I also requested a full explanation or clarifications of all my charges or a full refund even before I received a letter from Ally that I am eligible to receive a credit 200 00 as part of their legal settlement for discriminating in auto financing I am not satisfied with the explanations that XXXX XXXX the bank s Executive Customer Relations provided hence my complaint

I had this account for 15 years At that time it was XXXX then that was sold to Metro bank and now First National bank bought it I never had a problem until First National bank got into the picture The buried me in overdraft fees and any other fees they could think of They took XXXX direct deposites and paid themselves at that point there is no funds to pay anything else I was n t aware this was going on because one the bank card was demagnitized two I felt my direct deposites were covering my charges which were XXXX dollars XXXXdollars gas food and the big one was paying the rent My direct deposite is from a part time job however it s important to me because it helps me pay the rent I m a widower I live with XXXX kids and put food on the table What I do n t understand about First National bank is that why is it when there is insufficient funds they do n t simply close the account instead of charging overdraft fees They do n t have anything written that they have the right to have overdraft fees so I do n t understand how they can charge me fees take everything then hand it over to a collection agency There is something fundamentally wrong that allows a bank to do this to the point of bankrupting an account holder I have been in contact with them on Fridays because that was the only time I had available one gentleman looked at my account looked at the fees then said he did n t have the authority to waive any fees and directed me to his manager XXXX XXXX She was supposed to get in contact with me and never did I went back the following Friday and told him what I wanted which was to have my direct deposites returned to me because I earned them second I want the fees waived thirdly I want the account closed He wrote that down and told me the regional manager has the authority to do so his name is XXXX XXXX and then never heard a word from him Meanwhile I feel as though they were stalling eating out the clock so they can bring it to a collection agency so they do n t have anything to do about it While this was going on I opened up another account and had my money moved to that account because it would have been an endless viscious cycle That other account there s an agreement that if there is insufficient accounts there would be a decline when swiped To have this thing go one and owe an exuberent amount of money baffles me and the only thing I can conclude on is that this is how the bank makes its money So they are looking to create scenarios to look into your account and to go around doing this As I stated before First National bank has no agreement to take my money to charge me nor did I agree to their policies on how they run their business I m a struggling guy and when I lost those direct deposites it was devistating

I have been a client of Wells Fargo for over 10 years and just received I have noticed some unfair business practices in comparison to my other banks I have a checking account and debit card associated with my account For the past few months I have noticed that Wells Fargo will hold transactions until close to midnight As it appears on my end if I have 20 00 in my account Wells Fargo will not posted my pending transactions until XXXX or so So if a charge come in at 22 00 at XXXX when I do not have the opportunity to make a deposit due to the time I am then charged with an 35 00 overdraft fee Surprisingly enough I have only noticed this close to close of business hold on transactions that will make my account overdraft This year alone I have paid over 700 00 due to these practices When I spoke to someone about my concerns they explained that transactions post when they occur which has NOT been the case for my account I also have a XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX account and I have never experienced them holding transactions until close to close of business My transactions posted shortly after I use my card and any ACH cards are posted earlier in the day Which if over drafted I have to opportunity to make cash deposits that post immediately 
I used Charles Schwab s Bill Pay to make payments on a XXXX XXXX loan that I had paid current since XXXX In XXXX XXXX I set up the account to autopay the loan through the loan s final payment in XXXX Instead of doing what it was supposed to do the system overrode the date I put in and set XXXX XXXX as the final payment date In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent a letter threatening collections and that was when I first became aware that Bill Pay had failed I paid the loan payments current and then had the Schwab rep get on the phone with the XXXX rep The Schwab guy said that the error was likely a Schwab system error but refused to send a letter or email to XXXX because of legal liability issues Apparently this is an issue they are aware of and are trying to limit liability with very little thought as to how it harms customers Schwab now refuses to admit its error and instead is telling me that I put in the wrong date They did not review their system or provide any evidence to counter my witness testimony The net result is that my credit has been negatively impacted I m trying to buy a house and the past due is hurting my credit score and could well cost me thousands of dollars more in interest expense Since XXXX continues to report my late payment from XXXX I will submit this complaint each month until Schwab resolves it Please treat it as a brand new complaint since every time XXXX reports this it affects my credit

I submit a complaint yesterday as well In short a garnishment was taken out of my account without me being notified at all from the law firm so my account is currently negative In addition to having all of my funds taken right out of my account I had a legal processing fee for 120 00 on my account causing it to go negative My issue is that my bank should be protecting me and not dipping into my account and taking money that does not exist and then attempting to charge me overdraft fees for them over drafting on my account I have already expressed my concerns with the bank but this needs to be resolved immediately or I will be taking my service elsewhere To me it seems like taking advantage of someone already in a poor financial situation and I will not stand for it Aside from the legal service fee and my bank over drafting on my account I had been informed today that the funds had already been processed and removed from my account for the garnishment I ve done a lot of research and know that legally I am supposed to have a 2 day period where my funds are frozen which did not happen it has not even been 24 hours During this time period I am supposed to receive paperwork for possible exemptions from garnishment from my financial institution which I have not received I check my mail daily and open everything I receive from my bank including bank statements I am fully convinced this is illegal since they have n t taken the necessary steps required by my state to allow someone to garnish money from my bank account I have contacted an attorney regarding this matter This charge was not on my account for this processing fee until yesterday evening whereas some of the transactions that are still processing were from the day prior I also believe the charges were applied to my account incorrectly in an attempt to cause me to incur additional fees and thus for the bank to collect more money from me I am filing this as a follow up complaint to exercise my rights as a consumer and to express my further concerns

On XXXX XXXX 2016 when checking my M T checking account balance online I noticed my debit card number had been stolen XXXX fraudulent transactions had been made totaling 420 00 I called the customer service line to have the card canceled and a case opened to investigate the fraudulent charges made On XXXX XXXX the funds were returned to my account On XXXX XXXX I was issued a letter stating that a review of my account was done and a thorough investigation was completed to determine that the transactions in question were processed correctly and no error had occurred therefore denying my claim All except XXXX of the XXXX fraudulent charges were extremely out of nature for my spending habits though The biggest purchase was for 290 00 at a XXXX I have never stepped foot in a XXXX nor do I have a membership to XXXX Another was for an XXXX Taxi for 28 00 I rarely ever take taxis but instead use applications such as XXXX or XXXX to order cars There is a transaction also on XXXX XXXX for XXXX for 4 00 which I purchased Why would I be in an XXXX and then take a taxi XXXX of the fraudulent charges were made at a XXXX in the XXXX for 29 00 and 3 00 The location of this XXXX is an hour and a half away from my home and I have never been to that part of the XXXX in the 5 years I have lived in XXXX nor do I eat at XXXX or have ever charged my card to one The most bizarre charge was for 0 00 at a parking meter I do n t even own a car to park The last XXXX fraudulent charges were made at the XXXX XXXX in my neighborhood which I shop at I believe this is where my number was stolen The charges were for 58 00 and 7 00 I had made a purchase at that Rite Aid on the same day for 10 00 but the other XXXX charges were not made by me Despite all of these contradictions my bank refuses to believe I did not make these charges and they took the money back out of my account on XXXX XXXX I called the customer service line to reopen my case on XXXX XXXX and was told it was being looked into once again and the money would be put back into my account It never was Tired of talking to representatives on the phone I went into my local bank branch on XXXX XXXX in XXXX to talk to a physical person I explained my situation to one of the agents there and she faxed over my documents to the fraud department and had my case officially reopened This was on XXXX XXXX By XXXX XXXX the money still was not returned to my account nor did I hear anything from my bank I went into the branch once again and spoke to the same agent to see what the status of my case was She said she had not heard anything from the fraud department since XXXX XXXX so she called them while I waited When talking to the person on the phone who was handling my case she informed me that they were not going to reinvestigate my case and stick by their original claim that there was no fraud made She said that they would not communicate this to me directly and had no plans to inform me of this The person on the other line would not speak to me so I was being told all of this information secondhand through the woman assisting me at the bank The person on the telephone claimed that all XXXX purchases were made using chip insertion so it could n t have possibly been fraud since my physical card was not stolen And since the chip is unique and original to each card they are highly difficult to replicate I was then told there was nothing else I could do and I will not be getting my 420 00 back If the person did a proper investigation they would find that my signature is not on any of those purchases And I highly doubt all XXXX of those locations where the fraud occurred are up to date with chip technology I would challenge them to go as far as to look at video surveillance because I would be far from present at any of those locations

On XXXX XXXX 16 I called TD Bank to inquire about a 100 00 ATM withdrawal shown on my Convenience Banking Statement for a withdrawal date of XXXX XXXX 2016 I spoke with a man identified as XXXX with a first name of XXXX I made it abundantly clear that the information I want is the EXACT location of the ATM machine from where the money was withdrawn I stated this several times to XXXX that was the purpose of the call so I could trace back my activities for that day and time to a specific location and discern if indeed I visited the location from where the ATM was used as I could not recall withdrawing any money from an ATM on that date You can see from the attached email chain that the bank did everything but answer my question that is to know the exact location of the ATM machine On subsequent calls they only read back to me the same information already provided in the statement to wit XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX That is NOT an exact location XXXX runs for XXXX miles So it is clear they are unable or indifferent or holding back information on the exact location I believe they are obligated to pass on that information Yet if you read the email chains uploaded in a txt file you will see that they are just spewing out the same information over and over again without telling me where the ATM machine was located Again I am asking for them to identify the address with street number of the ATM Thank you

In 2010 I was involved in a fraud case with navy federal I was contacted by an investigator XXXX He told me to come out XXXX this was something they were aware of they had XXXX suspects Make a long story short they have locked and arrested the inviduals up which I have later found I been calling Navy federal to find out how do I handle this and they have not provide with any type of assistance only to pay my debt but this is completely a fraud case the guy from XXXX took my money and never giving me any car he have my social securitt number and much and many more 
I closed an account with Citibank in XXXX they did not close the account because it was reopened by a charge This is legitimate however I was never informed for 4 months when I finally got a letter stating I had an overdraft of 110 00 I called customer service and was told by a manager at the call center that ALL the charges would be reversed and the account would be closed The following day I do not receive an email confirmation as requested so I call again to ask another customer representative who tells me that I still have a balance of XXXX No notes were entered to reverse any charges at all Nothing was done they basically lied to me about reversing the charges Finally they reverse some charges and I end up paying a balance of 59 00 and closing the account 59 00 is n t a lot of money but it s just the principle the fact that a company tells you they will do something then does n t do it then adds an overdraft charge and makes you pay anyway I am not interested in Citibank s response because I know that they will just deny that this ever happened I just hope that enough people complain about the same thing over and over again that this causes them to be fined by the government What your customer service team did was unethical and unprofessional you should not have made me pay overdraft charges in the first place since I was n t even aware that the account was open and you certainly should n t have lied and told me you would reverse all the charges

I recently received a fee for an item that was paid XXXX XXXX 16 from my Bank BB T even though I had and still have more then enough in my checking account to pay the check The system in which BB T executes their overdraft fees is very suspicious The person at customer service at BB T said I received the fee because on XX XX XXXX the check was sent for payment Not only did I have enough in my account to pay the check but I also had a cash direct deposit that morning and another XXXX XXXX 16 Throughout the weekend I used my debit card watching to make sure the funds were still available and even made a deposit Saturday morning just in case The banks methodology is that throughout my transactions that weekend all of my debits worked against me and I did not receive credit for my deposits reasoning their over draft fee but that seems very in genuine all while not being notified that a check is posting to my account Instead it posts 3 days later along with an overdraft fee First if the bank wishes to apply the charge on XX XX XXXX rather then XX XX XXXX I feel that should have been reflected on my account that day and not XX XX XXXX since as stated my account could handle it Hiding this information has no real substance other then keeping the consumer in the dark in order to have them slip up Also their voodoo accounting of what counts for that day and what does not sounds very heavy handed in order to reach an outcome in which they profit As their customers we deserve some visibility to situations happening with our accounts and deposits should carry as much weight as debits even if they are pending 
I was naive about the information I submitted online believing as long as there was a lock locked where the website name was typed in that it was a safe and secure site I was searching for a loan that I would be able to payoff in longterm small installments I needed a loan to be able to have enough money to get into a new rental home I being unaware that these companies shared sensitive information with other companies was contacted through an email that I had been approved for a loan of 300 00 I gave the site my name social security number my bank account number and routing number even my online signature I was then contacted by an employee who asked me to please go back as he walked me through the steps of repeating all of my private personal information as well as my signature again I was under the impression that all that I would need to pay back would be 390 00 total with interest but that I would be given adequate time to do so either in small monthly payments or after an adequate amount of time until I could pay it back in full I was shown a payment plan that unless I paid the entire 390 00 back within two weeks that I would become locked into a payment plan that would start with 100 00 being the first payment due within the two week period of recieving the loan Soon after another payment would be due costing me even more than the first payment and so on until I would end up paying around 1600 00 or more total for a 300 00 loan I spoke to a man who is from Student Loan XXXX helping me with a loan in default from 1997 I still owe a very small amount on I consulted with him about this loan I seem to be trapped in and he recommened that I contact my bank as well as you because he checked out the company and said it has had many similar complaints and that people like me fall victim to this all of the time not understanding exactly what they are getting themselves into and that I also need to protect myself from identity theft because these companies share your personal information to other companies I was unaware that anyone but me could ever access and take from my bank account When I spoke to an employee at my bank they recommended that I contact you first and that if anybody were to try to attempt to collect money from my account without my permission that I should then change bank accounts which would be extremely inconvenient but necessary if nothing else can be done 
JP Morgan Chase Bank XXXX OH XXXX pulled my credit report without my authorization I did not seek out a vehicle loan from Chase

On or about XXXX XXXX 2016 I elected to open an account with PNC Bank I was told I would receive a bonus of 300 00 if the following requirements were met by 60 days Deposit 5000 00 make XXXX debit transactions and send a payment for any amount I checked with the bank in XX XX XXXX after completing the requirements I was told the requirements were met and the bonus will be added to my checking account At 60 days I contacted the bank to check the status and was told the bonus was not attached to the account The bonus would be in my account no later than XXXX XXXX 2016 I called the bank and was told I did not qualify because the 5000 00 was simply deposited at a branch and the bonus required a business check I feel deceived because the bank held my money and now refuses to honor the bonus Adding insult the bank will charge my account 25 00 to close the account because 180 day has not elapsed The marketing rules for the bonus were not fully discloseddisclosed

Good afternoon I purchased a XXXX from XXXX XXXX in XXXX NC XXXX XXXX Since the purchase of the car I have been XXXX and transferred my duty station from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX I had not realized that I was delinquent in my payments and that the car payments were not current During this time my mom who lives in XXXX is helping me straighten out the payments I also told the finance company XXXX XXXX that my mom had my authorization to call and talk to them regarding the loan Due to my job and training I can not always be available to accept phones calls or call out to follow up After my mom reviewed the auto contract she believed I was a possible victim of predatory lending due to the interest rate being so high And she also how I even qualified for the loan On XXXX separate occasions my mom called XXXX XXXX and asked them to confirm what my monthly income was On both occasions XXXX XXXX said it was 4100 00 Now it s no long a question of how I qualified This is fraud on behalf of XXXX XXXX My monthly income is only 1900 00 a month We asked XXXX XXXX to send a copy of the document they received from XXXX XXXX and both times they said they do n t have access to the info to send They suggested that we contact XXXX XXXX because they have all those documents I requested my file from XXXX XXXX and they sent me everything but the documents I really wanted which is the information they sent XXXX XXXX of my monthly income and the approval letter I had the law firm in XXXX write a letter to XXXX XXXX specifically requesting the documents but that was over two weeks ago and still no response XXXX XXXX the XXXX at XXXX finally responded and still refused to send the documentation I requested Since this mess has started my command has been involved in this which is negative for me This could potentially ruin my credit and any future career aspirations I would like to pursue in law enforcement Due to those fields being effected by how well your credit it Not to mention XXXX XXXX is threatening to repo the car This is an extremely stressful situation for me and I am asking for your assistance to resolve this issue quickly If this car dealership did this to me most likely they have done it to countless other XXXX I also ask that you contact my mom as she knows all the details in this matter and can probably explain details better than I can she is of the opinion that this should result in a huge investigation and people need to be held accountable As of today I learned that XXXX XXXX XXXX purchased XXXX XXXX and I called them to request the document that XXXX XXXX sent them indicating my monthly income at 4100 00 and they refused I asked if they only way to obtain the document was with a subpoena and he laughed and said yes

I utilize TCF Bank s online bill pay TCF allows you to set a deliver by date which is great except it rarely actually happens Historically my rent check is often delivered XXXX3 days AFTER the deliver by date I time my payments to correspond with my payroll deposits to make sure that I am timely with my payments I have payments going out biweekly The payee in this case is my Chapter XXXX Trustee for Bankruptcy repayment The payment that was to be delivered by XXXX XXXX was sent on XXXX XXXX and actually received on XXXX XXXX and then deposited on XXXX XXXX Meaning that the check was processed two days prior to my direct deposit from my employer TCF then assessed an over draft fee for the 500 00 Check as well as an automated transfer to a small investing firm XXXX As my direct deposit would not be delivered to the account until roughly XXXX XXXX XXXX there were no funds to cover the 500 00 check Historically all checks to this recipient have cleared the day AFTER the Deliver by date It is my belief that this practice leaves open a potential for fraud by processing mailed payment runs early collecting overdraft fees and then hiding behind some disclaimer That I can no longer view on their site

I decided to close my Comerica banking account after 44 years because it continued to charge me fees to maintain both a checking and a savings account and offered no interest on the deposits To close the accounts I transferred XXXX pension direct deposit checks to a new financial institution which offered interest on savings and fee free checking After waiting two months after the XXXX direct deposits were stopped at Comerica and three months after establishing my bill payments practices via the checking account at my new financial institution I received a statement from Comerica showing no new checks cashed against the account for the past two months and a 13 monthly fee to maintain the unused checking account and a 12 monthly fee to maintain the unused savings account balances I transferred the remaining savings amount to the checking account and wrote a final check against the account for the remaining balance after subtracting the fees from teh balance and deposited the amount in my new bank thinking I was done with Comerica After the final check from the Comerica account cleared that account and showed up in my new bank account I went to the Comerica account s on line access to learn how to formally close the XXXX old accounts I discovered a more than six month old check for 25 00 had been cashed against the account and found a negative balance on the checking account and a bad check fee added to it My next mailed statement which I was going to use to address the check issue while disputing the fee since the account had been closed showed the bad check amount the bad check fee a weekly recurring fee for outstanding bad checks and the usual 25 00 in service fees to maintain the accounts When I contacted the bank by phone I was told that the only way to close the accounts was to cover the bad check which I agree is correct and pay all outstanding fees and penalties Comerica generated against the accounts to which I object Now I have received a notice from a consumer finance loan firm acting in Comerica s behalf which said it must either receive a check for or make up a payment schedule to address at least 54 00 to close the matter as of the date of the printed notice but it ca n t give me a final amount until I call their XXXX to confirm there are no new charges I assume 25 00 of that cost is the amount overdrawn against the account but the remaining cost is the fees I dispute with Comerica

In XXXX 2014 I saw a poster advertised on the window front of my local Suntrust Bank It promised a bonus of 150 00 for opening a new account as it read It s never been so easy to earn 150 00 and on the bottom it read For a limited time we want to offer you a 150 00 gift card just for signing up Inside the bank I was explained that I d have to have a special account that could accept credit card payments I told the rep that I do n t really need to process credit cards but was persuaded anyways to open an account I was assured of getting my bonus after just XXXX credit card transaction I received a swiping device for credit cards for my smart phone soon after I processed XXXX card for 1000 00 and when I got the statement I was shocked to see a charge of over 80 00 as a processing fee I was sure it was a mistake and called the bank so they could correct it They denied that it was a high fee stating that it was a competitive fee for processing credit cards That rate sounded very high to me so I asked them to close my account I was told Sir if you close your account now you ll be charged an early termination fee of 500 00 If you want to avoid this penalty fee you d need to wait for 1 year for the contract to end before you can close your account However we ll continue charging you our standard monthly fees for that time 1 year and then we ll refund you retroactively for that year I was surprised to hear all this since nobody ever explained any of this when I was signing up On the day I signed up I was in the bank for about XXXX7 minutes and was told to sign and initial in a few places and the rep did n t give me any time to look over the documents saying It s just the standard stuff all banks ask you to sign In any case I did n t put up a fight deciding just to wait out the year to avoid the 500 00 fee I waited patiently for 1 year not paying too much attention to the exhurbant fees I was being charged knowing I d be getting them refunded soon However when the year was up I called the bank to close my account and to my surprise I was told Sir your contract is for 3 years and if you close now you ll be subjected to the 500 00 early termination fee I could n t believe my ears I tried to explain that I was told it would only be 1 year but the other party did n t want to hear of it I was also told at that time that no fees would be refunded to me After calling and emailing different parties at Suntrust with no success I had to close the account early I ended being charged 500 00 as an early termination fee It s been 2 years since I regretfully opened up an account with SunTrust Bank They charged me close to 1000 00 in fees and still send me letters claiming that I owe them more money They recently threatened to report me to a collection agency which will affect my credit score if I do n t pay up Please help

I regularly use Chase Bank s ATM and Branch deposit services but today I decided to try out their Chase Mobile phone app to deposit a check With all three services the wording is nearly identical on any disclaimers Essentially deposit by the cutoff time and your deposit will be processed that day Funds will be made available within 24 hours Any holds placed on the account can affect funds availability With both ATM and XXXX deposits courtesy funds are made available to the account until the checking funds come through This is not mentioned anywhere on the deposit slips but has happened every time I have ever deposited via ATM or Branch over the course of several years There is nothing to indicated when depositing a check through Mobile that it is different from ATM and Branch deposits and courtesy funds are NOT made available In addition if you should decide say because you are mad about the deception around courtesy funds to cancel the deposit you ll then learn that you can not cancel deposits placed via Mobile Again nothing prior to placing the deposit via Mobile mentions these sharp differences between Mobile and ATM or Branch deposits No courtesy funds no ability to cancel deposits The only advice I received from speaking to Chase reps was to essentially present the check at another bank with faster processing which would then force cancel the Mobile deposit as a 2nd presentation I feel there should be specific wording clarifying the differences between Chase Mobile Deposits and their ATM Branch deposits Namely that courtesy funds will NOT be available and it is NOT possible to cancel a deposit once initiated

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX color and not leather interior Recently last XXXX the XXXX I went to a XXXX more dealer asking for a vehicle and I did select a wonderful and very good vehicle However I did n t appreciate it with the necessary numbers about the risky negotiation that I was doing and in fact I did signed The expectation was to bring this vehicle into a productive base with an specialized firm in a people transportation That company suggested to me to visit this dealer and they will benefit me with a financial help and because many other doors were closed here and there I got extremely happy and this is the numeric critical situation 45 00 in a credit to be paid in full during the next 4 years 1300 00 monthly payment to the car I started to produce with the company which offered incomes with the vehicle XXXX big mistakes I did promote buying this vehicle A To expensive for the purpose in where the vehicle qualifies Or a wrong vehicle to be qualified for a better incomes B The company for which the car is being doing a passenger pick up in a clear average paid for this vehicle the same amount that pays for a conventional not older than XXXX sedan does n t matter the brand or the color Asking for your collaboration A credit is signed and running with Exeter financial account number XXXX Incomes produced by this vehicle 1 00 start and 00 by the mile plus 00 per the minute Making a new deal which I had to did before to get a vehicle now I m in the process to reach and hold a TLC driver license and license plates and insurance that will takes more than 60 days to be effective if lucky But also the vehicle will stays outside of the appropriate ran ge to produce the expected incomes average because the color and interior materials do n t matches with the regulations for the convenience of the new license and plates What I m asking to your office To speak with the money provider Exeter XXXX to extend the credit to more than the 4 years now signed Hopefully 7 years In order to lower the monthly amount Or and preferable To transform the buying contract that I signed for a lease contract which will benefit me lowering the monthly cost and making possible to paid the vehicle without the actual risk to lost it To ask to the dealer to replace the vehicle for some similar value and usage even in a different brand from the same cars factory which can be a XXXX or XXXX with the appropriate characteristics of color and interior finish to complete with regulations for the for hire passengers industry in XXXX however must be same price to cover the Bank or Exeter financial institution with the real value of the title possession I can not imagine how could be the future if I do not take any action right away The worst scenario will be to lost the vehicle for the Bank Exeter reposition and to keep paying the difference remaining from a deal they will make with the now used or second hand vehicle with XXXX miles now it have It will to stay paying about 15 00 for the next 4 years without vehicle and incomes from the benefit of it So your help is extremely important for the mistake I did due to my own ignorance about small rules which are the main means basically they wrong selection of vehicle that I did made because size color and interior color for the next step as a TLC NY vehicle where the XXXX do n t qualify for black car service and the incomes will never compensate this wrong effort that I did took for my family and myself XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CEO XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
My complaint is about Navy Federal Credit Union It has come to my attention that my current auto loan is now nearing almost 4 years of payments I decided to go over the amount I have paid and what is left to pay on this loan Based on what I have calculated I have not even paid off half of the original amount financed Based on my XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX statement I have 23000 00 left out of 31000 00 that was originally financed XX XX XXXX Additionally I have calculated out the last 11 months worth of payments which equaled 4800 00 to which 1600 00 has come off of my principal balance That means that 3100 00 had gone towards the interest charged on my loan The average amount that is getting paid toward my principal is 150 00 and 280 00 goes toward interest That is nearly twice as much Based on the figures that I stated above it would take me approximately 153 4 more payments to finish out this loan That is another XXXX years on a loan that was only supposed to be for 84 months or 7 years So this begs the question Why am I going to pay 15 years on a 7 year loan I would literally be paying 67000 00 to pay off the 23000 00 that is remaining I renegotiated this loan XX XX XXXX to get a lower payment because of financial difficulties but apparently the interest stayed the same so nearly XXXX of every payment goes to interest This is ridiculous in my opinion 
I am having difficulty resolving an issue listed on my credit report with SANTANDER CONSUMER USA a creditor I have attached a copy of the account for your review Here is an explanation of my account I fell behind twice on my car loan and it was repossessed in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX A fee of 370 00 was added to the account for both occurrences I paid my car off of the principal balance in XXXX XXXX In XXXX XXXX the car loan continued to be extended for fees incurred by the creditor even though my principal balance was paid in XXXX XXXX The payment changed from 240 00 to 200 00 a month during this process In XXXX XXXX 7 00 showed as the remaining principal balance XXXX XXXX the same amount showed as a principal balance of 7 00 It continued and in XXXX XXXX the balance was still 7 00 even though I paid the principal off in XXXX XXXX I paid the 7 00 on XXXX XXXX XXXX The balance as of XXXX XXXX XXXX now shows 0 00 cents When my counselor and I called SANTANDER CONSUMER USA they said they are keeping the account opened with a 0 00 cent balance so they can collect over 1000 00 in fees I believe this is not only unfair but negligent on the creditor s side I have already paid the balance in full and the creditor continues to charge me fees I am seeking to resolve this matter with your help and request the fees to be removed entirely and make the balance on my account reflect zero on the credit report 
I went into a CheckSmart located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ohio to cash a check in XXXX 2015 The teller XXXX was in a huge hurry because she was scheduled to be off She quickly called the number on the check to verify the check and funds and cashed it Today XX XX 2015 I am getting threatening phone calls from XXXX XXXX at Checksmart Corp telling me I know why he is calling me and he has plans for me to answer to the law my life is over huge threats he is making I have no idea what is going on because he was too busy threatening me and telling me I already knew why he was calling This is in no way how you conduct business 
On XXXX XXXX and finally on XXXX I attempted to transfer 21000 00 from our account at Wells Fargo to our account at XXXX On the XXXX I contacted XXXX from the Wells branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX and he provided specific instructions to make this transfer through XXXX XXXX s fed wire agent routing number account number account name etc while on a conference with Wells desk officer The instructions were prepared by the desk officer and the funds were wired Next day the funds were returned as owners of the XXXX account had not been included This was corrected on the XXXX but again the funds were returned due to a typo On the XXXX the exact title of the account was recorded and the funds were again wired however the account title was too big for the computer field and the last XXXX letters of the last name were truncated Unfortunately this wire was accepted and the funds were applied not to XXXX s account but to the account of a XXXX retail customer When XXXX finally determined what had happened on XXXX or XXXX they messaged Wells to explain and further said the funds would be refurned within XXXX days On the fourth day XXXX informed Wells that they had gone to the incorrectly funded account to retrieve the money but the funds were n t there and therefore XXXX would not be returning the funds and that furthermore XXXX was closing its case on this transfer Iwas informed of XXXX s decisions on XXXX and further told that as XXXX had closed its case there was nothing further that Wells could do and that Wells too had closed its case The matter was eventually referred to an executive resolution team and on XXXX I was informed by a team member that there was nothing that the bank could do We have our rules If you are unsatisfied by our decision you should get a lawyer I responded that only Wells Fargo had the standing with XXXX to argue for the return of the money and I believed that Wells was obligated at least by good business practice to pursue my claim but was told again to get a lawyer we re sorry but we have our rules and there is nothing that I can do I am told by attornies that litigation will likely cost more than 20000 00 and that Wells ill likely respond by giving the matter to XXXX of its retained law firms with the instruction to make this problem go away As courts are reluctant to award damages to cover the cost of litigation it seems that I am frozen out Frankly I suspect that this arithmatic is central to the bank s rules which seems predatory I am pursuing counsel and every other venue which I can think of 
I financed a care XX XX XXXX for a little over XXXX It is XX XX XXXX and the amount owed on my car is XXXX I also put down XXXX when I purchased my car I made payments on time for a year like I was told and that Santander Consumer would report every 27 days and I would then be able to get out of my car which held a high interest rate within a year That did not happen I dont understand whats going on Although I made payments on time for over a year I am not stuck in my car paying money towards a loan that is ultimately not decreasing

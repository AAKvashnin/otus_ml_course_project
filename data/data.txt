I have had a loan with a principal balance of 64000 00 since 2013 It is now over 70000 00 due to accrued interest Interest has been a nightmare for me and I am sure plenty of other students I was tipped early on to pay attention to interest and pay it down while in school and I did so I even paid some of the smaller school loans off in full before my loan went into effect in 2013 From the get go I have always been on an income based plan At that time there was no way I could afford rent utilities daycare etc along with a 700 school loan payment each month When I was first applying for the income based plan I spoke to a representative about it in general He explained to me that the payments are lowered but only low enough to cover interest As such I was always under the impression that the payments were only as low as the interest that accrues each month Otherwise what s the point I do not like to let interest accrue I do not want to risk having any accrued interest capitalized I would not have agreed to this if I knew better I feel I was misguided Anyway I started the plan I set myself up for automatic payments I went on with life until I felt I could start paying down my loan After some time I noticed the balance on my loan jumped from XXXX to over 70k How did my balance increase after I have been making payments on it regularly I called to question it and learned that it is due to 6000 00 of accrued interest My payments are less than the amount of interest accrued each month so it has been racking up without my knowing Who knows if it has even been capitalized I keep trying to find documentation to figure out so but I can t find anything to help me much The rep says it isn t capitalized So here I am ready to try to tackle some of my principal and I can t because I have a ton of accrued interest to work on before I can even touch principal I feel helpless What s the point of having an income based or other plan when you are struggling financially All you are doing is paying and or accruing interest never touching your principal I thought the income based plan lowered payments yet still applied to a portion of principal and interest in a pro rated fashion to what the regular payment amount would be This is not helping us ,Student loan

To Whom It May Concern I started paying extra on the loan on XX XX 2018 Then I notice the payment amount going down and the due date getting further away On the first occasion I spoke to the company Nissan motor acceptance corp the rep told me that my extra payments were being applied correctly and that if I payed extra it went to the principle I asked why does my payment amount change and the due date get further away He gave me an unsatisfactory explanation about some customers like that so if they need to pay latter or pay less they can I told him I didn t want this I didn t ask for this and I wanted my bill to go back according the loan contract It did not as you can see in the attached documents the payment keeps getting less and the due date further away In my opinion they are doing this to trick people into paying less so they can earn more interest This should not be allowed I have a loan contract and they should be bound to follow it I called again and told them I wanted to see how my payments were being applied and they sent my an amortization schedule instead And as you can see it is the same payment amount and the same due date every month This made me more suspicious that they were hiding something So I called back and made sure the rep this time understood that I want to see how my payments were being applied and the interest paid the accounting in other words When I got that as you can see the interest payments go up and down It should be going down continuously not up and down like this I feel Nissan is not applying my extra payments correctly not applying the payment consistently on the same date and they are not following there own amortization schedule I need someone to look at this that knows how this should be it just doesn t look right to me Thanks for the help Sincerely XXXX XXXX,Vehicle loan or lease

I received a check in the mail in XX XX 2018 for 1200 00 stating the total payback would be 1400 00 which included 210 00 in interest for 10 monthly payments I cashed it and eventually received a payment reminder stating the first payment was due on XX XX 2018 and that if I needed any more money to contact the office Two days before my first payment was due I called and talked to XXXX about a payday loan I had with an extremely high interest rate and we discussed them loaning me another 500 00 to pay the higher interest payday loan off it was considerably higher than the rate that was quoted on the check I had received and cashed from Tower Loan in the mail and I assumed the 500 00 would be the same rate just added onto the first amount When I went to make my first payment XXXX said she got me approved for the extra 500 00 but in doing so I was not made aware of the fact that the interest rate was changing from the initial 36 99 to 60 48 So now my loan payoff total was at 3200 00 I felt like I had gotten a scam pulled on me and like it was clearly a bait and switch kind of tactic They will say I was given a full refund of all the interest which I am assuming they are referring to not charging me the 210 00 on the original loan of course not why would they when they had somehow just suckered me into paying 1500 00 in interest for an additional 500 00 added to my original loan of 1200 00 I would never knowingly have agreed to such absurd terms I was never informed of them nor do I have a signed copy of the contract I was never given one They had also added some bogus insurance for collateral that I do not nor have I ever owned I told them 3 things I had which were an XXXX desktop computer 10 years old an XXXX laptop 8 years old and a XXXX circular saw 5 years old everything else on the list was added by them at her suggestion They also pushed an Accidental health insurance policy on me which was of no use to anyone as I was currently off of work awaiting scheduled knee XXXX at the time I then received another check in the mail for 1200 00 at 36 99 same as the original first loan check I had received from them as I was still off work recuperating from the XXXX I needed the money and against my better judgement cashed this check knowing I could easily pay it back since they were only charging a little over 200 00 interest No problem as soon as I was back to work to pay this off I received the paperwork in the mail stating the payments would be 140 00 for 10 months So now I had 2 loans one with 26 payments of XXXX one with 10 payments of 140 00 which combined was 260 00 a month On XX XX 18 I went in and asked if we could combine the two loans to simplify things into one payment over 26 months and they agreed and we settled on an interest rate of 43 24 The paperwork was signed she handed me a sealed envelope with my account number and the information 26 payments of 200 00 each written on the outside of it with the first payment to be made on XX XX 2018 I walked out feeling like I hadn t gotten taken too awfully bad Then I received a payment reminder in the mail stating my balance was 7400 00 I got the still sealed envelope with my contract in it I hadn t ever opened it since it clearly stated the terms we had agreed upon on the outside of the envelope I never dreamed the contract inside would say something completely different and not even be the one I had signed There is no signature of mine anywhere on this copy of the contract The one in the envelope stated I was to make 36 payments of 200 00 not the 26 payments like we agreed to I went there twice and tried to talk to her to explain this was not what we had agreed on and I clearly didn t sign this contract and was refusing to make a payment until it was straightened out because in doing so I would be accepting the terms that I did not agree to ,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"
Transaction Date Posted Date Description Amount XX XX 2018 XX XX 2018 XXXX 1000 00 XXXX On XX XX 2018 I XXXX XXXX made a reservation via the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX website for a stay from XX XX 2018 through XX XX 2018 Note Apparently they are affiliated with XXXX in which is what reflects on my credit card statement I never agreed for my personal information including my credit card account number to be shared with XXXX I was under the impression that all my information was only going to be shared with XXXX Original reservation was for a condominium privately owned located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX with a living area square footage of 1 282 Refer to Exhibit 1 On XX XX 2018 two days prior to checking in for my intended reservation the owner of the condominium XXXX XXXX notified me via email that she was moving me to another condominium that she owned due to a slight possibility that the swimming pool at original condominium reserved might be closed during the week of our stay XXXX Refer to Exhibit 2 Reservation was moved to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX 0 6 miles away with a living area square footage of 960 Refer to Exhibit 3 XXXX XXXX XXXX Appraisers Office Living space record of original condominium reserved and living space of condominium moved to The condominium moved to was 322 square feet smaller than original reservation Exhibit 4 0 and 4 1 On XX XX 2018 I replied to Mrs XXXX email making her aware that it concerns me that the condominium in which she moved me to was smaller than the original condominium on my reservation Note Two days before the check in date was extremely short notice and unacceptable I kind of accepted the last minute change due to the fact that with only two days prior to checking in it was going to be a challenge to find another property where to stay with my family Refer to Exhibit 5 0 and 5 1 The distance between original condominium reserved and condominium moved to was 0 6 miles according to XXXX driving directions On XX XX 2018 at approximately XXXX XXXX I made several attempts to reach Mrs XXXX via her cellular number of record However I was not able to reach her On XX XX 2018 at XXXX XXXX I sent Mrs XXXX an email making her aware of my dissatisfaction with the size of the condominium that she had moved my family and I to I even requested for Mrs XXXX to rent me another unit at the same location in order to avoid having to move to another location The unit could of being a bit bigger or just simply another condominium for a total of 2 units in order to feel comfortable during our 7 night stay On the same email I also discussed with her another matter that was brought up to her attention by XXXX XXXX from the management office Refer to Exhibit XXXX On XX XX 2018 at approximately XXXX XXXX Mrs XXXX showed up at the condominiun unannounced while my wife was alone inside the condominiums exterior lanai with the sliding glass door closed and was unable to hear Mrs XXXX knocking on the door Mrs XXXX allowed herself inside the condominium without any justifiable reason Again my wife was the only person inside the condominium while Mrs XXXX was knocking on the door My wife was extremely frightened by Mrs XXXX unannounced presence inside the condominium since she was a total stranger as far as she knew As of the date of this letter my wife still remembers Mrs XXXX actions and continues to have nightmares as she did the same night when she went to bed a few hours after Mrs XXXX left the condominium Mrs XXXX actions were extremely unacceptable and constitute an unethical business practice Not only that but she also acted reckless and could have caused a deadly situation since we always travel with firearms for our protection When I made Mrs XXXX aware that my wife didnt like the fact that she just allowed herself inside the condominium unexpectedly Mrs XXXX stated that she had knocked on the door several times and didnt get an answer So therefore she let herself inside Refer to Exhibit 7 Mrs XXXX response Refer to Exhibit 8 Once Mrs XXXX made contact with my wife inside the condominium she told her that she was there to discuss a situation that was brought up to her attention by XXXX XXXX from the management office at approximately XXXX XXXX In which was the time when the second part of the party arrived at the property She then informed my wife that she needed to speak with me and for her to please reach out to me I was only downstairs in the beach area speaking with other guests that were there looking at dead fish by the seashore In which we later learned the reason for the dead fish So therefore I immediately went upstairs and spoke with Mrs XXXX She stated that the management office informed her that there were a total of 7 guest in our party and that we had previously agreed to only 6 guest in the party when I made the reservation I again informed Mrs XXXX that I had already discussed and cleared the issue with the management office as I stated on my earlier email to her Mrs XXXX also stated again just like in an earlier email that the management office informed her that our party had to split and offered for me to rent another room condominium for a week at a different property Refer to Exhibit 6 I informed her again that my nephew was only visiting and that he would return back to my sisters rental unit soon She then informed me that she will allow my nephew to stay one night and that she was going to send me an email shortly and requested for me to please reply back stating that my nephew would only be visiting In which I immediately replied to her email Mrs XXXX then stated that the management office has previously called law enforcement officials in order to remove previous guests from the condominium because they had more than 6 guest in their party In which is not allowed per contract and per fire department ordinance She also stated that every time she sees a local number like my number on a reservation request it raises a red flag to her because theyve had issues in the past with locals In which to me thats considered discrimination and unacceptable For the record the situation was as follows Mr XXXX XXXX is a member of the condominiums management office He brought to my attention that only 6 guests were allowed during my stay per fire department ordinance Mr XXXX made me aware of the fire department ordinance due to the fact that he saw my cousin arriving with my XXXX years old nephew and was under the impression that he was part of my party I explained to Mr XXXX that my cousin his wife and their son were only part of my party And made him aware that my nephew was just going to visit for a little bit and then return back to where my sister was staying in XXXX XXXX In which wasnt very far from where I was staying Mr XXXX agreed that my nephew was allowed to visit However he still informed Mrs XXXX that our party was a total of 7 guests As previously discussed on this document Mrs XXXX waited until after XXXX XXXX to further discuss the issue in person even after she confirmed receiving my reply email And again she showed up at the condominium unannounced and allowed herself inside the condominium without any legitimate reason Mrs XXXX failed to address the issue regarding my dissatisfaction with the condominium via an email reply to my email sent to her on XX XX 2018 at XXXX XXXX or when she showed up at the condominium at approximately XXXX XXXX on XX XX 2018 So therefore I sent Mrs XXXX another email on XX XX 2018 at XXXX XXXX expressing again my dissatisfaction with the condominium Refer to Exhibit 9 On XX XX 2018 at approximately XXXX XXXX Mrs XXXX sent me a message via the XXXX message portal stating that the pool at the location where the original reservation was made was available for the rest of my stay I responded to Mrs XXXX stating that I have decided to stay at the condominium where she moved us to due to the fact that we had to pack and then unpack again clothes for 6 guests in which consisted of clothes for 7 nights And also pack and then unpack groceries that we had already bought for a 7 night stay I always agreed in moving to a larger unit or renting another unit where we were moved to Not packing and unpacking half a mile away

stated that he didnt hear anyone knocking on the door XX XX 2018 Checked out The issue with the small bedroom bathtub the lanais sliding door glass issue or the cleaning issue by the front door wasnt resolved The maintenance staff reported that he changed the wheels of the sliding door glass and adjusted them to the best he can However there were no signs of the wheels being replaced He just simply placed the sliding door glass back on the tracks and prayed for the best in which his quick fix didnt last very long To make matters worse Mrs XXXX knew that XXXX County already had the presence of the well known deadly and toxic Red Tide algal bloom During our entire stay we were not able to enjoy the beach area due to hundreds of dead fish laying on the shore and the foul smell in the air of dead fish We also had very limited use of the condominiums pool area due to the foul smell in the air of dead fish coming from the shore area During the very limited amount of time my family and I were at the beach and pool area we experienced symptoms of irritated throat accompanied by a burning sensation And also sneezing and tearing In which are symptoms caused to humans when they breathe the toxics of the red tide Other guests were also experiencing very similar symptoms The condominiums pool rules are that only 16 guests are allowed at a time due to its capacity So we were extremely limited on the use of the pool too Mrs XXXX failed to disclose to me the Red Tide conditions on the beach and the hazard to human health in which placed my familys and I health at risk My family had to be seen by their primary care physicians due to ongoing symptoms of being exposed to the toxics produced by the Red Tide In which they have paid for office visit co pays and

I am listed as a transfer on death for my mother s checking account On XX XX 2018 she died I contacted the branch several times by phone yesterday and today The first call was left on the branch manager s v mail XXXX XXXX I called to find out what type of paperwork I needed to bring for the money to be surrendered in my name He never called me back I had to place another call later in the day and spoke to a branch employee She advised me the paperwork that would be needed including the chain for my name change Today I received a call from forensics They stated the body was ready to be picked up and that we needed to make a decision on a funeral home or crematorium I asked about the death certificate and they said the final official death certificate would not be available for another 15 16 weeks due to the additional tests run on her body to determine the exact cause of death The stated a pending official certificate could be issued more quickly In the interim I contacted the bank to see what type of documentation they would accept I told them about the circumstances with waiting on the final but the woman stated she had verified with the branch manager that all we needed to bring was paperwork from the crematorium stating my mother was deceased and they would provide this when I signed the paperwork for her cremation The crematory sent me away with an unofficial pending death certificate I gathered all the other documentation and we headed to Commerce to take out money to pay for the cremation that my mother had set aside I explained that I only wanted part of the 1700 00 she had left in her account because she had written a check for 250 00 and we needed to make sure it would clear They stated they normally just closed out accounts but they would make a call to verify if they could handle the account this way withdrawing part of the money prior to closing the account When they spoke with legal the legal department inquired about the status of the certificate and the banking rep stated it was a pending official They stated they could not accept it despite what was told by the branch manager I complained that we had had several miscommunication problems with this location in the past which is why my spouse no longer banks with them In addition when I would take my mother to the bank she would routinely write checks out for 20 00 in cash Sometimes they would demand id and other times they would not My mother had suffered a mini stroke so she would need to fumble in her purse and wallet for sometimes 10 minutes at a time in drive thru in order to find it When I worked in banking there was a standard policy to ask for ids on checks that were 50 00 or more From what I have been told Commerce has no standardized policy on id and just makes rules at the branch level or depending on whether the teller wants to ask for it or not This in itself will end up making Commerce look like they are racially profiling if they tend to ask for ids on minorities more than Caucasians I left and called customer service to complain and to ask for a district manager to call me back and explained the nature of the complaint The first person I spoke to was named XXXX She spoke to her supervisor named XXXX and his recommendation was to go to another branch location if we were having problems with this location in order to withdraw the money It was like they did not even understand the nature of my complaint I told her this was not a solution to jump branches until the money was withdrawn and that I wanted a clear explanation of what I needed to bring official pending or offical final before I made another trip to a branch She then transferred me to another supervisor named XXXX XXXX stated she would give me the district managers name and number to speak to directly What she gave me was the branch manager s name and direct number I was furious I can not believe they are pulling this kind of nonsense on a person in the middle of a grieving process when the person is trying to get cremation expenses paid for This branch clearly lacks proper training and I expect a call back from a distract manager explaining exactly what they will take before I make another trip ,Checking or savings account

my wife and two other that I paid several years back they read the names and one that I didnt know was listed I was told that on the XX XX XXXXr 5 transactions were processed to a XXXX XXXX fraudulent via Chase Quickpay with XXXX equaling 4900 00 At that point I had to revisit the local branch again in XXXX tx and sign another affidavit stating this was unauthorized and fraud I requested all statements back to XX XX 2018 to verify any and all transactions I found no other questionable transations on Quickpay prior to the XX XX XXXX incidents Two days later I got my online portal set up for my quickpay again adding only my wife as a payee I made a test transfer of 20 00 to her to verify that it worked The next day a XXXX XXXX added themselves to my list of payees and made a 1300 00 transfer to herself All logins and passwords were changed as requested by Chase both phone and computer ran malware and anti virus as requested I had to again go to the nearest branch this time I went to the local branch in XXXX tx and closed the second set of business accounts and open another two A few days later I got an alert via text that a transaction was attempted on my wifes account but was rejected due to insufficient funds At that point we discontinued any online banking on my personal banking I notified the bank of her account being compromised The bank issued a temporary credit to my

and asked what has happened and I was told that the investigation was complete and it was found that the first 5 transactions on XX XX XXXX were from the same IP address as other transactions that were authorized I asked for the IP addresses and was told that they couldnt give me that information I told the Claims department that I wanted the claim to be elevated and appealed because it was

that were stated to be the reason for denial of the claim I was told that they could mail it to me and it was be 7 10 business days before I would get it Then I was told that sense the claim was denied on the XX XX XXXX I had 24 hrs to submit supporting documentation before the 30 day time line was up To date I still have not received a letter of denial from the bank After arguing the

Fifth Third clearly violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA while processing my Home Equity Line of Credit on XX XX XXXX One important reason that Fifth Third violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is that I experienced disparate treatment According to US labor law disparate treatment is when an individual of a protected group is shown to have been singled out and treated less favorably than other creditworthy borrowers A simple analysis of Fifth Thirds lending practices would obviously show that similarly situated borrowers not in the protected class do not wait an average of 12 weeks to close on a Home Equity Line of Credit HELOC A basic analysis of race data in HELOC applications would be more than enough evidence to prove that Fifth Third discriminated against me Now Fifth Thirds Office of the President has argued that they needed additional required documentation for underwriting and this was one of the reasons for the delayed closing But the complaint that Fifth Third has clearly violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act is still true Fifth Thirds additional documentation argument is flawed because every requested documentation was done electronically via email I have email evidence that shows the conversations along with the date and time various additional documentation requests were made by Fifth Third and the date and time I submitted them My quick turnaround submission of these documents will undoubtedly shows that their reason for a 12 week closing is dead wrong Another key reason that Fifth Third violated the ECOA while processing my HELOC application is the underwriting department created barriers making it more difficult for me to close within the standard timeframe Fifth Thirds initial operating procedure in applying for a HELOC is to run a credit check verify employment and home insurance for all applicants A basic review of Fifth Thirds HELOC application procedures will serve to prove that Fifth Third exhibited discriminatory requests from me that was out of line with their standard practice Of course Fifth third claims that the 12 week closing on the HELOC was due to clearing up a delinquency on my credit report verifying income and the mailing address on my insurance policy However the weight of the evidence is on my side What must be remembered is that these are initial steps in the application process and should have been verified months before I received a second request to provide this information again I also have email proof that shows the date and time I submitted the required documentation and the long time period in between Fifth Thirds second request for the same information months later A major reason that Fifth Third violated the ECOA with regard to my HELOC application is they have a pattern of discriminatory lending In XXXX Fifth Third agreed to pay the federal government 18 00 millions dollars after claims it charged XXXX and XXXX customers higher rates for auto loans This proves my situation is not unique but apart of Fifth Thirds standard practice of discrimination Fifth Third has admitted to providing me with misinformation about the type of appraisal I should receive but there are many more examples of how I was misled throughout the entire HELOC application process I have proof of multiple email conversations Ive had with the loan officer general and regional managers at the bank and the underwriting team at the XXXX Michigan location that clearly point out specific examples of disparate treatment All parties noted did nothing to rectify the situation after months of discontent Therefore I was forced to log a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Even after the complaint was logged Fifth Third made little effort to close on the HELOC Finally after 11 weeks I sent all noted parties an email stating I was drafting a personal letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX Chairman of the Board President CEO at Fifth Third and XXXX XXXX Consumer Complaint a detailed account of my experience with the HELOC process Ironically I got a call the next day asking me to come into the bank for the closing This not circumstantial it clearly demonstrates guilt and an attempt to cover up the disparate treatment I experienced Consider all of the evidence and reasons I provided there is no doubt that Fifth Third violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA Sincerely XXXX XXXX,Mortgage

I initially called to apply for an Equity Line of Credit modification loan only on XX XX 2016 and was then encouraged to include a modification on my Home Mortgage loan as well I was hesitant because I was ok with my Home Motgage due to my getting an HARP adjustment 2 years prior but the loan officer assured me that I had nothing to lose because I could possibly get a reduction on both loans by filling out just one form It was then explained on XX XX XXXX that I could be approved for one loan or the other both loans or none at all as to the possible loan outcomes At that point in my submitting my application it was not mentioned that one loan could be contingent upon the other if approved for both I later received a confirmation that I was appoved for both loans in XX XX 2016 I reviewed the Equity line of credit loan that I was appoved for and had liked the reduced interest rate granted which lowered my payments I then examined the modification on the Home Mortgage and found that it was not good It did not lower my interest at all but had simply extended my payments period for another 10 plus years As a senior citizen I d found that the Home modification was more detramental than helpful Hence I immediately called to accept the modification terms on the Equity line of credit and to decline the Home mortgage modification because it would hurt me in the long run It was then and only then XX XX 2016 that I was told for the first time that both loans were contingent upon the other to be accepted I felt this was unfair based on the fact that I was not disclosed this type of outcome before I submitted my initial application else I would have proceeded with just the Equity modification as I initially requested Again the option of both loans being contingent upon the other was not disclosed which smells of foul play by the WF Bank establishment I later opened an investigation complaint with WF who then noted that my original call was to indeed seek a modification on my Equity line of credit only and that I was then offered to include the Home Mortgage modification later on the call WF also noted that they do not disclose the possibilty of having the loans be contingent upon each other and openly stated that it was there right not to disclose the contingency clause or outcome and felt it was there choice even if it lead to an unfair outcome I again affirm that the first time that I was told that the loans would be contingent upon each other was after I filed the application and not before It was further reviewed with me when I tried to accept the Equity line of Credit over the Home Mortgage loan modification account XXXX and XXXX I will attach two letters below The First letter was in regards to my refuting the statements made in the first investigation letter that I then sent to the WF CEO XXXX XXXX In this letter I highlighted key inaccuracies in Red Ink which were in the investigation letter which smelled of a cover up The 2nd letter was admitted that they did not disclose the contingency outcome with both loans being approved ,Mortgage

Dear Sir Madam We are XXXX and XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been of an excellent credit standing all of our XXXX years of banking life with all creditors When I moved to XXXX XXXX to pursue my XXXX career in XXXX of XXXX prior to my husband arriving in XXXX I hired a XXXX year old assistant XXXX XXXX XXXX to assist me I am XXXX years old and I needed some technical help He was recommended by a friend who told me XXXX was good with technology and I needed an assistant prior to my husband arriving from back east to join me from XXXX XXXX after selling our home XXXX joined me and worked with me from XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX that final date being the date he stole our XXXX XXXX XXXX and went to XXXX XXXX worked from my home but I do not have an office therefore that is where I work It does not give him a license to steal He was paid 100 00 a day cash for his services I also took care of take out food and lunches to be kind He took advantage of our money and our high lines of credit It is shocking that the Bank Of America would rule against us for having an intern who has no job no residence no source of income against people like us at XXXX and XXXX who have worked a lifetime and maintained beyond excellent credit I hope one day they are taken at the hands of XXXX XXXX XXXX My husband and I phoned the police when XXXX took our car The police came to our home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and phoned Mr XXXX on his cell phone and ordered him to return the car immediately This was XX XX XXXX Mr XXXX refused that officer and returned the car 3 days later when he felt like it and was briefly arrested and let go It was during those days my husband and I discovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX stole over 200000 00 in credit card limits to include checking accounts and stolen debit cards etc The only bank who will NOT cooperate with my husband and myself is the Bank Of America and we have worked very hard or have tried to since XX XX XXXX the date of we discovered that the intern was stealing from us through online methods and icloud hacking At no time ever was XXXX XXXX XXXX authorized to use my debit card or any of our finances simply because he had access to them or worked in our home He is a thief and I tell you that as a XXXX year old law abiding woman who has worked a lifetime and not one blemish on my record or my husband XXXX XXXX record This is a disgrace and beyond and I plan to go to the XXXX XXXX with this story I am a writer And an award winning writer with XXXX credit The only reasons The Bank of America ever gave to us was that they were completely ruling against us and I will provide that documention as well here is that because he had access to it he was in fact in their eyes authorized to take whatever funds he wanted That has been the position the Bank of America has maintained despite a police report an attorney letter and the fact that we are XXXX year clients in excellent standing They have made their final decision based on that alone He was in the home and I allowed access I did not He hacked my icloud and gained access He took money from debit and credit cards unknown to his own gain financially He has stolen over 200000 00 All of the banks were hit up with the fraud by Mr XXXX but little by little they worked with me and the evidence and credits were given we are still awaiting a few It has been the absolute worst months of our lives and my husband XXXX a XXXX survivor is so ill from this theft that I am afraid he will become sick again It makes people like us think was it worth it to abide all the laws all the years of our life No one cares about us No one understands what it like to be violated this way Is a person who works freelance not allowed to have an in house assistant because when they do that assistant has a right to all that is in the home which does not belong to them Read the Bank of America s explanation to us Are we being discriminated against because we are seniors The Bank has no idea that I am writing a screenplay for one of the most known families in America and once I can say this will be national news about how they have treated us I had not had knowledge of this theft yet we are being completely blamed I was honest about the dates all my cards were at risk I reported it to the police I have an embezzlement report I had my other attorney write XXXX a letter attached My husband was back east receiving paper statements and paying them Mr XXXX XXXX XXXX is the criminal not us We have been punished by the Bank of America all summer for this giving us no credit THEY have not sent any statements for the credit cards and have ruled against us in the Debit Card fraud when XXXX took 3300 00 from the ATM at the XXXX XXXX in XXXX or whatever other ATM of Bank of America was used THE reason the Bank of America gave was he shouldn t have access to my card or my pin I could not agree more However that is why the Bank ruled against us Simply because he worked in my home He stole all things without my knowledge He knew my pin number because he hacked it along with my mother s maiden name our social security numbers and anything in our lives that remain dear to us Therefore I am going to show you all the evidence and tell you that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and multiple others all worked with us to eliminate the fraud And the Bank of America still has not sent statements to me for the 4 5 months They refuse to put back the money stolen from our ATM and I am appealing to you to assist us Thank you XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA makes it illegal for debt collectors to use abusive unfair or deceptive practices when they collect debts Midland has harassed intimidated used abusive practices coerced bullied browbeat oppressed made false statements took unfair action and threatened me Specifically Midland has participated in several violations of the FDCPA 1 Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy abuse or harass any person at the called number Odd calls started shortly after Midland became involved in my life in XX XX XXXX and were extremely harassing constant and pushy which is why I registered with Do Not Call but they didn t stop I placed myself on the Do Not Call list and made written and verbal notice to cease communications that was disregarded by Midland 2 Placement of telephone calls without meaningful disclosure of the caller s identity Thereafter I started getting financial aid calls that wanted my financial information I verified with my real loan servicer that this was NOT them calling as well as a call that was for a vacation winning where they said I only had to pay the tax via my bank or credit card information for a vacation I won When I said I didn t have an extra 100 00 for tax I was hung up on 3 The threat to take any action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken Multiple times in XX XX XXXX I was threatened in writing that I was going to be sued by Midland No court action has ever been initiated at any time 4 The use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer 5 The use of any business company or organization name other than the true name of the debt collector s business company or organization I also started receiving illegal robo calls all day long several times a day to say that my financial aid servicer was being sued and that wanted my financial information to qualify for their student loan program The recorded call said to put in my FAFSA ID which isnt possible since FAFSA IDs are non numerical or push 5 to get help I pushed 5 to see what would happen after several of these calls I was transferred to a call center The company answered the phone student loan help with no company name There is no company name or phone number ever given and the number that calls appears to be local but alternates with different local caller id phone numbers that can t be called back These types of calls appear to be

with Ocwen on my behalf because I could not get a straight answer from the servicer On XX XX XXXX I called Ocwen and spoke with XXXX XXXX He stated the modification was approved for 160000 00 I asked for him to explain what happened the last 10 years with the house and how come I was not told the house was still mine He stated the bank could not find me and they were waiting for my bankruptcy to become inactive so they could file for foreclosure again and that I should take the modification because its unlikely I ll get approved for a second one There are 3 things wrong with this 1st is that in the 21st century it s not hard to locate a person Especially if XXXX was able to do so 2ndly My bankruptcy attorney XXXX XXXX told me that discharging the debt allows the bank to reclaim the property unless there was something wrong with the original mortgage or the statute of limitations have run out On XX XX XXXX I called Ocwen and spoke with XXXX XXXX and asked for her to explain the statute of limitations to me and she could not but would submit a request to the research department on my behalf It will take 10 days On XX XX XXXX I called Ocwen and spoke with XXXX XXXX I submitted a request to receive any documentation available on the previous loan servicer so I can find out what happened with the first 2 foreclosures It will take 10 days Being fed up I XXXX what the Statue of limitations are in NY It states that 6 years after the acceleration event takes place the bank has to forclose It was shared with me that the event took place with the 1st action in XXXX The bank had rights to forclose by XXXX But the action was not completed Which allows me to use that statue in defense Acceleration can occur in three primary ways The lender notifies the borrower that they intend to accelerate the debt The lender demands payment in full of the mortgage loan The lender files a foreclosure action in civil court Any of the above actions will start the statute of limitation running and the lender will then have XXXXix years from that date to pursue a foreclosure action If the lender fails to do so they will lose the right to collect on any of that mortgage debt in the future through the courts including seeking a foreclosure I found 2 similar cases posted in XXXX Six years seems like a long period of time for a lender to file a foreclosure case so it is natural to wonder when the statute of limitations may actually come into play This is when we remind you of the often incredible length of the foreclosure process in New York To best understand the role the statute of limitations can play in foreclosure cases we will examine some cases in which it was successfully asserted in New York courts either as a defense or as an affirmative claim XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX this case the full unpaid balance of the mortgage loan became due in XXXX of XXXX and the borrowers the plaintiffs did not pay the balance When the lender defendant failed to file any action in court seeking a foreclosure through XXXX of XXXX the plaintiffs filed their own legal action to have the balance of the debt canceled based on the expiration of the statute of limitations Ultimately the XXXX XXXX Supreme Court agreed thatthesubject mortgage should be extinguishedbecause the lender took no action within the statute of limitations The mortgage payment obligations were then effectively ended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX v XXXX The borrowers defendants stopped making payments on their mortgage so the lender filed an initial foreclosure claim to collect the entire mortgage amount in XXXX of XXXX The case was never completed and the XXXX XXXX Supreme Court dismissed the case without prejudice in XXXX In XXXX the new owners of the mortgage filed a second foreclosure action and the borrowers asserted the defense based on the expired statute of limitations The court dismissed the case agreeing that the lender no longer had the right to seek a foreclosure of the mortgage Due to the loss of my home in XXXX I have suffered from XXXX XXXX and XXXX At XXXX years old I gave every penny saved to be in my dream home and have suffered the loss of that since If it s in my right to keep my home I would like to do so It was advised to me to not sign the modification I will follow that advice ,Mortgage

A Contained herein is a summary of my complaint summarizing why I believe that I am the victim of Fraud Predatory Lending Practices and Deceptive Business Practices 1 On XX XX XXXX I voluntarily entered into a contract as what I told and believed to be a co signer for my ex boyfriend and father to be of my child for a vehicle loan to purchase a XXXX XXXX financed by the American Honda Finance Corporation AHFC At that time I was XXXX years old a full time student working 15 to 20 hours per week part time work study making 10 00 per hour a position I had held for 3 months prior My only previous employment was a one year job as a XXXX at an XXXX XXXX during my Freshman Sophomore years in high school 2 Based upon my above cited income and work history I was told that I was approved to co sign for my ex boyfriends car with AHFC for 34000 00 at an interest rate of 4 59 for 72 months See enclosure 1 copy of contract received XX XX XXXX 3 My boyfriend at the time of the purchase worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX where the vehicle was purchased At that time I was XXXX and would do anything for my boyfriend thinking that we were going to be together and he needed transportation to work and help support our coming child I was surprised and questioned the finance officer on how I was approved there and could not be approved for my own car at a XXXX XXXX dealership the same corporate entity The finance person at the XXXX XXXX dealership said since my Father was the primary borrower on my car it would not interfere with me co signing my boyfriends car 4 After breaking up with my boyfriend childs father he experienced several employment challenges sporadically made the payments and eventually defaulted on the loan During the times when his payments were late I received calls from the AHFC on numerous occasions informing me that the payments were not being made timely and that I was also responsible and that I should make the payments My response was that I would make all of the payments if they would give me the car They never responded to me nor agreed to my offer 5 In XX XX XXXX When I applied for a loan to purchase a home the mortgage loan office informed me that there was a derogatory mark on my credit in the form of a credit charge off by AHFC See enclosure 2 6 When I contacted AHFC they informed me that the car had been repossessed and sold for 7800 00 almost half of what the vehicle Market Average Price 14000 00 per XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX by XXXX estimates for Private Party Value See enclosures 3 and 4 leaving a balance 16000 00 that they are asking me to pay 7 When I asked why I was not afforded the opportunity to take over the loan they replied that they had sent a letter to my ex boyfriends address on XX XX XXXX informing me of the repossession and the intent to sell the car In short I was never contacted prior to the sale of the car and provided an opportunity to address the matter prior to the sale of the car Yet AHFC had contacted me on previous numerous occasions when my ex boyfriend was not making the payments on time They apparently lost all my contact information when they repossessed the car I requested a copy of the letter and received it on XX XX XXXX See enclosure 5 copy of letter mailed to me at ex boyfriends address dated XX XX XXXX 8 I also requested a copy of the contract and payment history at that time AHFC refuses to provide me a copy of the payment history and only sent me a copy of the contract and letter dated XX XX XXXX after a second request When I received a copy of the contract I discovered that I am listed as the Primary Buyer B I believe that my ex boyfriend the XXXX XXXX XXXX American Honda Finance Corporation AHFC and other agents of the AHFC the recovered asset vender who sold car for half the average market value intentionally conspired against me to commit Fraudulent and Predatory Lending Practices based upon the following reasons 1 Fraudulent Lending Practices In that the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the AHFC in an effort to finance one of their employees my ex boyfriend who they knew was not qualified for financing knowingly misrepresented my position in the transaction took advantage of my trust and listed me as the Primary Buyer in the contract when I was told otherwise while knowing that my credit worthiness did not warrant approval for such loan As the Primary Buyer I should I have been required to have insurance on the car prior to it being driven off the lot I never insured that vehicle nor was ever required to insure it by AHFC or XXXX XXXX XXXX All parties received incentives to commit this fraud my ex boyfriend received a car the Honda dealership received a commission AHFC received principal and interest payments on the loan and the XXXX XXXX XXXX received a vehicle for half its value all to my detriment 2 Predatory Lending Practices Various sites on the internet all state that there is no legal definition of predatory lending in the United States However all state that Predatory lending benefits the lender and ignores or hinders the borrowers ability to repay the debt These lending tactics often try to take advantage of a borrowers lack of understanding about loans terms or finances Modern usage has expanded the term to include any lending practices that rely on a consumer s lack of sophistication or gullibility Based upon my lack of credit worthiness at the time that I was duped into signing this contract I should have not been approved for this loan AHFC XXXX XXXX dealership and my ex boyfriend conspired to commit a predatory lending practice against me All parties received incentives to commit this fraud my ex boyfriend received a car the Honda dealership received a commission AHFC received principal and interest payments on the loan XXXX XXXX XXXX received a vehicle for half its value all to my detriment Deceptive Unfair Business Practices My ex boyfriend the XXXX XXXX XXXX American Honda Finance Corporation AHFC and XXXX XXXX XXXX engaged in deceptive and unfair business practices in that they intentionally deceived me by leading me to believe that I was co signing for my ex boyfriends car when it was known that he nor I possessed the credit worthiness demonstrating the ability to repay a loan in the amount of 33000 00 All parties received incentives to commit this fraud my ex boyfriend received a car the Honda dealership received a commission AHFC received principal and interest payments on the loan XXXX XXXX XXXX received a

exist in XXXX as a foriegn entity and didnt obide by XXXX Annotated Code XXXX which states they must file an amendment notifying the Secretary of The that is was not a foreign entity and withdrew as a XXXX to continue to conduct business in XXXX They did not XXXX failed in the oversight of this so they continued to exist on Secretary of State website No amendment was ever filed and they did not exist any longer as a XXXX corporation No assignments could have been made without a proper party XXXX is defunct and as such Mortgage Electronic Registration System is incapacitated moving forward so no assignment should occur through Mers And also meant the home is unsecured from the inception 2 XXXX XXXX XXXX was required by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to obtain a license to become a lender in XXXX which also requires fingerprinting and a XXXX XXXX bond put up They are also required to obtain a license from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Non of ever this happened 3 During an a securitization loan audit several things were identified in that the loan is included into two trusts and there can no be more than one title to a home Furthermore means that another company could also attempt to collect at some as well as Investors being defrauded within either trust No two titles to one home There is no such thing 4 XXXX XXXX XXXX ceased to exist as of XX XX XXXX in a

XXXX XXXX to exist on any contract thereafter it ceased XXXX XXXX XXXX also was not registered with XXXX XXXX XXXX nor license or registered with XXXX Meaning XXXX XXXX XXXX could not have given any authority to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX not any other entity And Mers never held the note to be the bearer to transfer anything So no trustee could have existed 5 XXXX transfer of the corporate assignment of deed XXXX went onto to Mers system and stated it was the investor to transfer this deed to XXXX XXXX as Trustee for the trust The Pooling and Servicing agreement clearly states XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the Servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX merged into XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is far from the Investor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was not referenced in the chain of title until this point And when received the servicing rights from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so it should have known who the investors of the loan was The owner was unknown XXXX mispresented itself on MERS as the investor to collide with XXXX XXXX to clear up the clouded title However this was an illegal assignment which makes the party on record seem to be the proper party The assignment also missed the cut off of the trust per the prospectus by 4 years 6 Ocwen Ocwen in order to correct the issue signed as attorney in fact for XXXX XXXX as Trustee of trust yet they didn t know if XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was the owner which they claim in responses to me the servicing were transferred by them but later in Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act Respa requests it didn t know who the owner was inadvertently and intentionally alluding the truth Furthermore to correct any issue of the note and foreclose they would have to make XXXX XXXX the substituted trustee However when doing so the attestation of the signature of Ocwen s employee who the notary was personally known to was forged by a XXXX XXXX with the title of XXXX XXXX During researching other substitute trustee appointments in XXXX County XXXX Registry of deeds several other assignments were found where XXXX XXXX signature is forged 2 and 3 months before On these Ocwen was assigning substitute trustee to a trust and XXXX XXXX XXXX prepared and filed itself This would effect foreclosure had a fraudulent signature was not used 7 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX not one time was clear about who they represented nor who the owner of the note was During eviction proceeding they presumed they are the note holder Yet they did not produce anything but a copy and they only had a person employed by Ocwen to confirm by affadavit that they had the business records to prove it This doesn t prove the signature XXXX XXXX XXXX is acting as trustee when if fact the trustee of the deed never existed They never validated the debt They never sent default notices before the foreclosure 8 Two Different Legal Descriptions Original deed of trust filed XX XX XXXX shows on County Registry of Deeds in XXXX County XXXX a incorrect description And rerecorded to correct the illegal description Yet no authority shows as to who made the correction nor was a copy of that given to me Also it was altered without any verified authority There is nothing attached to it to show that Furthermore XXXX XXXX trustee of the trust could not have vested interest into the correct legal description of the home because according the prospectus the trust can not accept new assets after the closing date of XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX is when it was rerecorded on county registry of deeds It was passed the cut off date to be included into the trust Hence is why you see the loan included into two different trusts as well No two titles to one home And this all means that the debt is unsecured and the house is not collateralized 9 In Bankruptcy filing I filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed a proof of claim representing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as attorney in fact for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX as nominee It never mentioned the rerecorded deed In a

enforcement There s were no alleged corporate deed of assignment isnt done until 2 years after this XXXX XXXX XXXX is appointed as successor trustee 4 years after this filing The opposite has occurred The assignment contradict what s on file in a U S court which is proof in itself 10 Securitization In order for anything to have happened the chain of assignment to be correct the following would have had to occur A XXXX XXXX XXXX or Mers as Nominee to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to seller under the trust XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or any successor C XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Depositor XXXX XXXX XXXX

What I am requesting 1 I want Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to set up an appointment to personally meet with one of their supervisors or attorney at the Customer Care and Recovery Group to go over my loan modification robo signers from notaries employess of trustee attorneys trustees affidavits missing or defective false declarations false recorded documents wrongful foreclosure inaccurate accounting history and over charges of my account I can help them see how they violated the law If any citizen of this country did what WELLS FARGO BANK NA and their vendors have done we would be spending years in prison 2 I want a payoff statement breakdown I have requested for months a detail breakdown of who got paid and how much what is the interest rate paid late fees BPOs mortgage insurance property taxes and attorney fees and if there are other fees to specify the exact fee and what was paid I really want to know how much it was paid to THE SERVICER TRUSTEE THE INVESTOR 3 My house was wrongfully foreclosed and I was wrongfully denied a loan modification and I want my house back I am only using what WELLS FARGO BANK HOME MORTGAGE AND THEIR TRUSTEES HAVE SENT ME and what the law says The financial crisis and 10 years laters there is still no stop to fraud In XX XX XXXX I became late on my payments In XX XX XXXX Wells Fargo Home Mortgage recorded a notice of Default approximately 25 000 dollars I offered the servicer XXXX dollars to prevent further default and requested to have the rest of the money to be added to the principal or create a re payment plan The servicer customer representative told me not to pay the money that help was coming for homeowners like myself who had the pick a payment from XXXX XXXX and XXXX that there was some special arrangement for those type of loans Little did I now that I was being pushed to further default and eventually to foreclosure From XXXX it was the non ending loan modification loan process The application expired the servicer did not receive a document my copies were not clear ect On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Trustee recorded a notice of rescission of notice of default which cancelled the XXXX notice of default On XXXX a new foreclosure process started again with robo signers no interview from the servicer but yet they recorded a declaration of compliance on XX XX XXXX and it was signed on XX XX XXXX The thirty 30 had not passed as it was now required by the new laws and California homeowner bill of rights The XXXX pick a payment and the Assurance Agreement for the pick a payment were settled and a new Hamp Tier 1 an Tier 2 program was now introduced but I was now denied for a loan modification based on NPV a complex formula designed by the government and based on this formula I was denied for a loan modification On paper they never said you have equity on your property this is the reason we will never will give you a loan modification or any type of work out option What I was told was sell your home you have equity in your house There is not only document that has been recorded that does not show consistent fraud to the court the documents pretend to be in compliance when they are not in compliance with the law or deed of trust The over charges on fees and the lack of accuracy in the accounting is amazing hidden fees in the lump sum of interest rates and mortgage statements The mortgage statements never show the principal loan balance There is no way to calculate a monthly mortgage payment without knowing what loan balance the servicer is using Over charges in escrow fees still mortgage insurance home inspections late fees BPOs as high as XXXX dollars miscellaneous fees and others The undisclosed fees that you do not know what is paying but you must pay because they are charging it to you My house was wrongfully foreclosed on XX XX XXXX The substitution of trustee was recorded on XX XX XXXX and 6 days later the Notice of trustee sale was recorded XX XX XXXX The sale date was schedule for XX XX XXXX I had a XXXX on XX XX XXXX and I was in the hospital for over 2 weeks The foreclosure law deed of trust and my legal due process were ignored by Wells FARGO HOME MORTGAGE The trustee substituted itself as attorney in fact and recorded false documents as accurate documents There is no recorded notice of default they did not cause a notice of default and both the trustee and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Executive office were made aware that there was no recorded notice of default The wrongful foreclosure continue until the house was sold The Trustee Deed Upon Sale recitals are not in compliance with the non judicial laws and deed of trust this document fraud The foreclosure was irregular and the tile was not perfected There was not reason for me to have been in default for these long when I was able to afford my payment and I was willing to offer them partial payments to accept the balance to be added to the loan amount or have a balloon payment at the end of the term of the original loan No matter how much I tried to work with WELLS FARGO HOME MORTGAGE EXECUTIVE OFFICE I found nobody who had integrity and were able to see the dishonesty deceptive and fraud that was going on with my loan only because I had equity on my property I lost my house due to my equity WELLS FARGO target home owners who had equity and kept them in default until they were able to take their homes XXXX XXXX target minorities who had equity in their homes and put them in the highest negative amortization principal cap rate of 125 while most other banks use the max 110 principal cap rate My loan file has been reviewed so many times and the interesting thing is that the executive office of WELLS FARGO HOME MORTGAGE the highest level of customer complaints has never found any wrongdoing and has not corrected any of their wrongdoing I lost my only asset I had my family purchase this home in the XXXX s with many sacrifices working 6 days per week and I lost my house to a bank that is lawless all because I had equity I lost my health my low property taxes and we lost safe place to live This is a home that just it was passed to me I wanted one of my children to have it The bank continues claiming no wrongdoing and as long as they are claiming no wrongdoing their documents correspondence points to illegal violations I will continue fighting for my house I have sent them several documents showing what the law says regarding the laws they have violated I also sent them a request of items that I would like to have since now I am a defendant to the surplus funds of the wrongful foreclosure of my house The trustee wants to be released of any liability by the defendants The trustee did not provide notification of the foreclosure to the defendants and foreclosed illegally and wants to be released from any liability There seems not be any justice I am enclosing the documents that wells Fargo claims there is no wrongdoing and there is no violations found by the executive office I have written on the recorded documents which are public information for your review of the violations found that can not be denied by WELLS FARGO As long as WELLS FARGO BANK NA EXECUTIVES ARE NOT MADE accountable for the many crimes against their customers the millions and billions in fines is just like a license to continue growing their fraudulent enterprise ,Mortgage

The purpose of this letter is to request your assistance in obtaining information regarding the above referenced loan Specifically specialized Loan Servicing SLS will not provide me with basic information regarding this debt such as what the amount my monthly payment should be on or what the balance of my loan is I ask that you please demand that SLS make this information immediately available to me now and in the future Background Sometime in XX XX XXXX we were informed that our mortgage was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to SLS About that time we also began to fall behind on the payments SLS did not send us monthly statements and despite our many requests would not tell us exactly how much we needed to pay to come to current We tried to call SLS but were always sent from department to department No one gave us a clear answer Not even SLSs web portal would tell us what our payment should be We were ultimately reduced to guessing that we owed when we made a payment Over the period between XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX we paid approximately 6400 00 Despite this SLS continued to send us demand letters On Friday XX XX XXXX we received a certified letter from SLS which informed us that the debt was referred to an attorney for foreclosure We called the number provided on the letter but was never provided with amount to come to current on the loan We were told that the foreclosure trustee would contact us with the amount in several days As of the date of this letter no such contact has occurred On XX XX XXXX we made several calls hours of time being routed around from one department to another always getting the runaround from each person and this went on for days Each person we spoke to gave me a different answer and we followed each one this went on for weeks During one of the conversations it was said we could request it verbally and we did so on XX XX XXXX and again on XX XX XXXX After days of waiting and more calls to follow up we got more of the runaround and then on XX XX XXXX another person told me to send a letter give a fax number department and details of what needed to be included so that we could request this pay off amount We sent the letter immediately doc 1 On XX XX XXXX we again contacted SLS and with multiple calls to verify request was received and being processed we were again getting the runaround they seemed to intentionally stall us and were not tell us the amount necessary to come to current on the debt alleged We had the money and are ready to pay it immediately but SLS and their representatives were unable to tell us how much to pay or where to pay it Later that same day Friday XX XX XXXX a notice of trustee sale was delivered to our home doc 2 This notice stated that we could bring the account back into good standing by paying delinquent payments The notice instructed us to contact the trustee lawyer for payment instructions We called the number provided sent the signed request letter to the trustee lawyer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and once again were not given a number for the delinquent payments After multiple attempts starting on XX XX XXXX to contact XXXX for the Reinstatement Quote finally on XX XX XXXX date XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent us an email notification that the delinquency was 7300 00 and due on XX XX XXXX doc 3 We immediately made payment for this amount in person at the XXXX XXXX XXXX doc 4 To make matters worse we have been waiting for either SLS or their law firm to send us the notice that shows it was paid and the foreclosure has been cancelled As of today that still has not been received We took it upon ourselves to look into the County Recorders website and find out what if anything has been updated and about a week ago we found the Cancellation Notice of Trustees Sale dated XX XX XXXX And what we found to be even more unfair is a letter received dated XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX both in an envelope dated XX XX XXXX received on XX XX XXXX with confirmation of receiving our reinstatement request advising me of it being sent to the wrong departments and providing us a balance with a due date of XX XX XXXX doc 5 Had we relied on SLS or the trustee to provide us with timely documentation we would certainly have lost our home in a foreclosure sale Thankfully this did not happen but it shows that they are not following the rules and abusing the system to gain unfair advantages over consumers Currently we have again tried to use their website to access our account We are unable to get statements our current amount showed states XX XX XXXX however aside the payment made to XXXX XXXX we have not made any payments because we have not been able to get a monthly statement and amount owed To make matters worse when I click on the site to make the payment listed on the attached doc 6 the amount changes and there is nothing to understand why We again are being placed in a situation where we are unable to pay our mortgage with understanding where all the money is being applied Argument We are not sure if SLSs failure to communicate even the most basic information concerning the debt was a deliberate act or simply a sign of negligence Regardless if SLS is permitted to continue on in this respect it is inevitable that we will soon repeat this foreclosure crisis It is unfair and abusive that SLS has caused us all this distress and harm when we made it clear that we were willing to pay all our deficiencies All the late fees and other penalties could have been avoided if we were timely provided the proper payment information Not only have we suffered from stress and had to pay many additional costs but our ability to borrow had been compromised In order to get away from SLSs abuse we consulted with mortgage brokers about our refinancing options We were told that because SLS reports that we have a record of late payments we will not qualify for a loan that we can use to replace the SLS loan On other words because SLS sabotaged our attempts to make payments on our loan we can not get a new loan ,Mortgage

I am enrolled in an income driven repayment plan with Navient which requires a yearly verification of income Every year I timely file my paper work yet Navient systematically ignores the receipt of the documents allowing the deadline to lapse which results in a capitalization of the interest After the first occurrence of this in XX XX XXXXI would make repeated calls to the Navient after sending my proof of income to ensure that this would not occur In general it would require 3 to 4 calls insisting that the paper work had been sent in a timely fashion and demanding that the acknowledge receipt of the documents and officially update their records to indicate that they had received it This was an incredibly frustrating process and it was clear by their actions that Navient have been acting in a bad faith It was not a one time occurrence I faced this same scenario every year when attempting to renew my income driven repayment plan Although this was a nightmare to deal with I thought my persistence had prevented any further unwarranted and erroneous capitalization of interest However due to my mistake I did not regularly check on my loan balances and aside from my yearly fight to remain in the income driven repayment plan I did not pay close attention Recently I checked my loan balance and noticed it was much higher than I recalled and was able to determine they had capitalized interest in XX XX XXXX I know that I had timely filed my paper work as I do every year I think it is telling that my final payment of the prior year was processed interest was capitalized and days later my payment was adjusted for my new income Despite my timely filing of the paperwork Navient allowed the time period to elapse solely so they could capitalize the interest and processed the paper work for the recalculation days later In my opinion this is an example of the systemic fraud undertaken by Navient ,Student loan

not and that I would have to go to a moneygram store agent and have those payments refunded to me I spoke with 3 different customer service representatives and was told that I could go to any Moneygram agent and have the agent call XXXX and ask for the escalation department at which time they would authorize the agent to refund me the money This did not work after multiple attempts at multiple stores agents even going back to the original stores where the transactions were done after multiple phone calls to Moneygram in between all of this running around getting rejected and accused of scamming The customer service representatives were not helpful at all even making me try and guess which stores I needed to go to after originally telling me I could go to any moneygram store agent The Moneygram agents in the store did try to help me by calling the XXXX and asking for the escalation department but after spending 30 to 60 minutes on the phone they were still not authorized to refund the money It was a nightmare An embarrassing humiliating frustrating nightmare I made numerous calls to Moneygram all of which got me nowhere It should be noted that multiple review websites have numerous complaints about Moneygrams customer service department including consumer affairs having over 600 complaints registered on their site alone regarding Moneygram Frustrated after having spent an entire 2 days driving around trying to get my money I pulled my car over and XXXX until I found the number to the corporate headquarters in XXXX Texas XXXX and finally spoke to someone named XXXX XXXX in analytics who was able to pull up each of my transactions and could see which ones were processed and which were not XXXX printed them all while I was on the phone with him confirming that they were indeed done correctly on mine and the XXXX agents end and that Moneygram owed me a refund He then forwarded these to their compliance department He said he would ask that they issue me a refund check and would do his best to get it escalated He said it may take 7 10 business days This was on XX XX XXXX I have called XXXX repeatedly since then and get the same answer every timeit has not been approved yet I called on XX XX XXXX and asked to speak to someone in Compliance department I was transferred to XXXX in compliance I explained to him my situation and he knew who I was He gave me the case number that had been assigned to my refund XXXX He was familiar with my case and said it was just waiting approval from the compliance department director I explained to him that it had now been over 5 weeks that Moneygram had held my money and wanted to know what the delay was He could not answer that question other than that it had to be approved by the director He told me he would ask her the director about it and circle back with me that day He did not I waited a week and called him again XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX leaving voicemails He finally returned my call late on XX XX XXXX giving me no answer other than he would try to get his director to call me that afternoon She did not Moneygram has now held my money hostage and I assume in their

they needed to refund me the money I am at my wits end and really need my money I had to scramble and borrow money to pay the bills that Moneygram did not pay yet they have my money to do so In my mind it is theft I do understand that it is a large amount of money which causes people to speculate and scrutinize my bills but it is nobodys business what my credit card balances are I paid Moneygram to perform a service that they offer to the public Whether it was a glitch in their system that caused 21 payments to not be paid or unwarranted scrutiny on behalf of Moneygram I do not know I would like to believe it was just a glitch as 27 payments did in fact go though However the fact that Moneygram is NOT processing those 21 payments nor giving me a refund I have to question their business practices and am exploring as to the legality of their keeping my money for over 7 weeks now Just keeping it I have been patient compliant and have given them more than ample time to refund my money They have no valid reason AT ALL for keeping my money Can you please help me The phone numbers i have for Moneygram are 1 XXXX is XXXX and 2 XXXX number is XXXX I have kept meticulous records

Bank of America refusal to refund non authorized payments on my debit card This started in mid XX XX 2017 The remainder of this complaint refers to withdrawals from my debit card made to a merchant in XXXX totaling XXXX dollars The first 3 non authorized transactions were for XXXX I followed protocol on a timely manner by phoning Bank of America and notifying their fraud department The employee said no problem and explained the procedure I informed him that my wallet had recently been stolen and my card was in the wallet I also informed him that i had never once in my life ordered anything directly from XXXX or received anything directly from XXXX As i would repeat and plead with them the same statement over the next year time and time again No problem again i was told and that the money would probably appear back in my account in the next couple of days showing a temporary credit until the investigation was complete I will state that im not ware of any correlation between my stolen wallet and these XXXX transactions that im aware of nor is Bank of America Sounded good to me The nightmare has only began I received a new card in the mail and would watch for the return Next up was a total of 22 transactions that were two separate claims one being XXXX and the other being XXXX Same XXXX merchant same response from me only my card is now present and im beginning to panic because that wiped out my entire account that ended up being XXXX non sufficient Again i followed the timely protocol by phoning the fraud department only this time to seem to have better news Evidently i caught it so fast the employee said that was going to be very good because payments to XXXX had not been sent He stated if you have not ordered anything and you do receive merchandise to refuse it and let them know Sounded good to me He then stated it would take 10 business days to receive temporary credit while the investigation took place No good this time i was unemployed and we now had no money XXXX or XXXX cash to us is a very significant amount of money I explained to him that i was not disputing a credit card charge of a XXXX dollar pair of tennis shoes this was money that had been stolen out of my account He did inform me that since the money was significant they could expidite the claim and i would receive the deposit within 3 days worst case 5 days There was nothing else i could do Now here we are almost one year later i have not received a dime I have tried to do the right thing always being corteous and on several occasions giving them a solution to this problem within 2 weeks They have stated all along that this is not cash but on my statements under the large withdrawals are international transaction fees that range between XXXX and XXXX dollars each My solution notify the merchant You have a written contract with them There you will find what their services are and most likely the products they sell You will have a physical address and transaction numbers unique to their terminal payment system You will also have a phone number Call them give them my information tell them i am disputing almost 13k in fraudulent charges They will find it if its legit Find out what my XXXX bought that some thief has stolen from me They will have shipped it and yes they will have the shipping information I dont know maybe its XXXX or XXXX Lets say its XXXX Call them give them the information from the merchant Within minutes they can tell you when it was shipped the physical address it was shipped to a phone number who it was shippped to the time and day it arrived and there is going to be a signature That signature will not be mine This may not be able to be done over the phone but with overnite shipping we are done in 2 weeks max ONE year later not one dime deposited into my account The research ive done says i have rights Federal regulations called REG E written by the FEDERAL RESERVE I happening to notice that one regulation states total full refund even if temporary must be done to the consumer until the investigation is complete within a ten day time period Not one dime in my account Can you think about possible circumstances of this over this amount of time Late fees no payments repo of automobile FICO score dropping daily They have closed this case and reopened it three times due to my pleading for them to help me rectify this Now they say their policy states it can not be opened anymore and thats alll they can do Wonder what they have done Reg E reads to me pretty broad protection for the consumer It appears that they must prove that i authorized the transactions which will never happen They have given me a recent reason that on one earlier occasion i had approved a transaction in mid XXXX and since i approved it then that every other transaction i guess until eternity i will be responsible for I feverishly tried to run that scenario by a supervisor to no avail Maybe im wrong but i believe

I purchased a used paraglider on XXXX from a seller in XXXX using PayPal to process the transaction The XXXX listing expressly stated that the wing was in good flying condition and completely usable and I contacted the seller to confirm this before buying it The listing stated very low hours on this wing and there is no problem flying with this wing When the paraglider arrived I was leaving on a trip and didn t check the contents of the package until several weeks later I took the paraglider for a day course with a certified professional instructor at XXXX XXXX of XXXX CA and he requested that he let me inspect and test the wing with a standard porosity test before flying it in his course The paraglider completely failed the porosity test for airworthiness and the instructor immediately declared the paraglider unsafe to fly and estimated that it had a minimum of 300 hours of prior use meaning that it was beyond its safe operating limits for flight He would not allow me to fly the paraglider in the course as a result and stressed that there was no legal or ethical way this paraglider should have been advertised as airworthy I contacted the XXXX seller XXXX XXXX through XXXX to report the results of the inspection and to request an exchange or partial refund XXXX closed my request for a return without responding to multiple messages from me I contacted him again through the PayPal dispute resolution center and he escalated my support request to a full dispute claim again without responding to my messages directly in any way PayPal sent me a message telling me they d agreed to process the return and refund and instructed me to ship the paraglider back to XXXX in XXXX at my own expense They provided the shipping address and I contracted for international shipping via USPS through an online shipping broker called XXXX I paid the 160 international shipping fee online and sent the package to the address PayPal had given me I submitted a digital copy of the XXXX shipping label and the USPS tracking number XXXX to PayPal for tracking in connection with the dispute and return I had grave reservations about shipping the package to XXXX at my expense with no assurance that the seller would accept the return package I contacted PayPal to tell them I suspected the seller would do anything possible to avoid processing the refund including claiming he never received the package or interfering with the shipment at the local level I received no response to my concerns from PayPal I sent the package as they had directed While it was in transit I contacted PayPal again to stress that I felt the seller was acting in bad faith and would not accept the return and again I received no reply from PayPal The tracking information for the package stopped after it reached XXXX XXXX in XX XX 2017 and has not been updated since PayPal requires proof of delivery to complete the refund for the return but the USPS tracking information does not list the delivery I filed complaints with both XXXX and USPS to determine what had happened to the package To date both USPS and XXXX report that they are still conducting their inquiries to determine why the package has not been delivered Although the shipping inquiries are still ongoing PayPal closed the return case and told me they would not process the return because the shipping information I d provided them was invalid I called PayPal to dispute this and the service rep I spoke with on the phone took the USPS tracking number XXXX from me again confirmed that it was valid and re opened the return case pending more information from the shipping inquiry I asked to speak to the rep s supervisor for confirmation and she asked me to wait on hold for a supervisor After about 20 minutes on hold I gave up and hung up The next day PayPal emailed me to tell me that they d closed the return case again This time the PayPal email said that the item had never been eligible for a return because it did not meet the requirement of being substantially not as advertised I contacted PayPal again to remind them that they had expressly instructed me to ship the paraglider to XXXX for a return PayPal responded that the appeal was denied because I had already submitted that information and added that any further communication from me on this dispute would not receive any response from PayPal I paid 690 00 to XXXX XXXX via PayPal for a used paraglider that he explicity advertised as being safe to fly but which was determined by a professional paragliding instructor to be worn out and unsafe for any use in flight Because the seller was immediately uncooperative when I requested an exchange I would definitely not have paid to ship the paraglider back to XXXX if PayPal had not directly told me that I would receive a full refund for the purchase if I shipped the paraglider back to XXXX The messages from PayPal regarding this return case are undeniable As a result I followed PayPal s instructions and ended up losing the purchase price the paraglider itself which still has not been found and the addtional 160 00 in shipping charges that I paid at PayPal s direction My total loss in this incident is now over 850 00 and PayPal bears direct responsibility for the shipping charge at a minimum PayPal did not even dispute that they instructed me to send the item back to XXXX for a refund but they still insist that it is not eligible for a refund under their buyer protection program The USPS shipping information clearly shows that I sent the item to the address that PayPal instructed which should be enough information to show that I followed their instructions and have met the requirements for the refund ,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"

rep I said no I had only spoken with her for about 15 minutes on XX XX XXXX she then informed me I had broken the agreement and my car was out for Repo I explained that I was going to make payments

the evening of XX XX XXXX to let me know she s working on the case and that my car was not out for repo temporarily and that I should send her anything I had and I did I called her the next week

payment was NOT applied to my account therefore the car was no longer out for Repo She stated I was to call her back on the XX XX XXXX and she would include the Manager of the Loss recovery department and explain what happened and that I was not to work with XXXX So that s what I did XXXX was out on the XX XX XXXX so I phoned on the XX XX XXXX she kept me on hold while she communicated with the Manager of the Loss recovery department and then transferred me to XXXX who promptly told me she could n t see any payments so she was not going to work on a settlement with me when I said there were she then said I owed Wells Fargo XXXX a month for three months that the value of the car was more than I owed so there was no settlement offer I thought this person may not have all the information since it was the week between XXXX and XXXX XXXX so I said I would call back after the first of the year where XXXX said I could work with XXXX I was shocked I immediately phone XXXX back and explained the response and that I would call back the following week I phoned the loss recovery department on XX XX XXXX and was not able to get connected I spoke with XXXX emp XXXX who said that department was not open yet and reconnected me where XXXX XXXX answered from the same department as XXXX and tried to connect me again this time it went to XXXX XXXX from the office of the President Dealer Services answered and tried to resolve the issue with loss recovery she came back on the line and said the same thing about the value of the car was more than what was owed I asked her why I was offered a settlement this past summer when I owed more and the value was higher This is when I said this seems like retaliation for my submitting a complaint against that department and that I wanted to file a complaint that number is XXXX and the complaint is that i feel like it s retaliation against me for filing a complaint and now that department wo n t work with me I ve explained to XXXX XXXX and XXXX that I was ready to make a payment on XX XX XXXX 1400 00 a month for 4 months as a settlement Next I get a phone call from XXXX XXXX on the evening of XX XX XXXX explaining that the

said that one XXXX was closed because you ca n t have two complaints open with a single customer I told her I was ready to make a settlement payment of over 1400 a month she told me she has 2 to 3 business days to respond and would get back to me I had n t received anything in writing and was concerned so I called the office of the president dealer services and spoke with XXXX who read back the notes XXXX had taken during our phone call on the XX XX XXXX and it sounds as if XXXX captured my concerns so I waited to hear something from XXXX this past Friday the XX XX XXXX and did n t hear

JPMorgan Chase and their attorney XXXX XXXX are conspiring with the XXXX County California District Attorney to deprive me of my rights to hold property and right to contract by having the DA arrest me on false charges over a civil litigation dispute Theft of properties absent authority or right Chase has wrongfully foreclosed on my properties without the note and without authority has failed to surrender the original notes as required after foreclosure and has threatened foreclosure on other properties Chase has in hundreds of court cases pointed to the Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Receiver FDIC as evidence that Chase acquired XXXX XXXX XXXX s loans But the Purchase and Assumption Agreement states on page 10 that the means of transfer from FDIC to Chase is to be a Receiver s Deed or Bill of Sale FDIC has never issued any Receiver s Deeds or Bills of Sale to Chase because Chase did not supply FDIC with the required list of loans via schedule 3 1a as stipulated in the P A Agreement This constitutes proof that Chase has no claim on any of our properties or any other WAMU loans it has illegally foreclosed upon For the record I have never contracted with JP Morgan Chase ever for any financial product and I never intend to We have experienced years of continued harassment from JP Morgan loan servicing companies and attorneys They have inserted themselves into my and my familys lives demanding payments and threatening to take our homes if we refuse We have been living under constant threat for nearly 10 years and now the local prosecutor is threating 17 years in jail because I substituted the trustee on the public record after WAMU went bankrupt WAMU failed as a company because of their illegal sub prime mortgage scheme that targeted minorities knowing that we would eventually default due to their non disclosure of massive balloon payments and reverse amortizations that were built into these loans The criminal complaint must be withdrawn discontinue the harassment issue a quitclaim deed and pay damages to me and my family HAVE YOU ALREADY TRIED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WITH THE COMPANY Yes I have been in civil litigations for many years and JPM has never made any offer to settle anything Step 3 Edit this section What happened I am a XXXX XXXX having been brought to this country as an unaccompanied minor through the previously classified XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX XX XXXX I have been a XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX since XX XX XXXX with many successful business transactions and successful banking relationships in that time In XX XX XXXX I built a single family home in XXXX XXXX California and I obtained financing from XXXX XXXX XXXX WaMu WaMu went into receivership in XXXX and Chase claimed to have acquired all the assets from Receiver FDIC However it failed to conform to the terms and requirements of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement it formed with the FDIC failed to obtain from FDIC the Receiver s Deed or Bill of Sale on any of the loans it claims to have acquired An officer of WaMu who was hired by Chase XXXX XXXX testified that in the thousands of loans that were a part of this WAMU purchase Ive never once seen an assignment of mortgage or allonges or anything transferring ownership from WaMu to Chase J P Morgan Chase Bank vs XXXX XXXX XXXX CHASE S CLAIM THAT IT ACQUIRED WAMU s LOANS FROM FDIC IS PROVABLY FALSE In addition to the proof cited above regarding Chase s failure to obtain a single Receiver s Deed or Bill of Sale as stipulated in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement Chase s claim that it acquired all of WAMU s assets is also untrue The presumption that Chase acquired all of WaMu s loans is rebutted by the fact that more than XXXX XXXX of these loans were sold prior to WaMu going into receivership The U S Senate Sub Committee XXXX XXXX XXXX reveals in its findings of fact that WaMu sold and securitized at least XXXX of residential mortgage loans through its subsidiaries WaMu XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who acted as Depositors in the securitization transactions See https XXXX In the case of XXXX v JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX as Trustee have taken a position that universally applies to all XXXX XXXX of these securitized loans Each one of these loan transactions will show either the investor code XXXX XXXX or both somewhere in the Loan Transfer History screenshots within the servicing system and as such the loans were not purchased from the FDIC In the XXXX case a specific REMIC Trust is named in the action To prevail on its argument that the XXXX loan was sold and transferred to the Trust JPMorgan Chase and XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee both admitted stipulated that the loan contained both investor codes XXXX and XXXX in the loan transfer history which means the loan was sold by XXXX XXXX XXXX to the subsidiaries prior to those subsidiaries transferring the loan into the Trust AND it was stipulated that the loan was NOT PURCHASED FROM THE FDIC Thus the presumption that Chase has relied upon in order to maintain its position in thousands of foreclosure proceedings is that 1 it acquired the loans through the P A Agreement and 2 that the assignments of beneficial ownership interests to the loans unto itself as attorney in fact for the FDIC have now been debunked by its own admissions The alleged assignments of the DOT without actual transfer and delivery of the original note grants no authority to XXXX XXXX XXXX to bring its complaint or to foreclose as it is clearly not the holder nor a party in interest Without the original note and Receivers Deed or Bill of Sale Chase was without authority to transfer the DOT to XXXX XXXX XXXX And further absent clear proof that it acquired any of the WAMU loans it claims to have acquired its complaint to the District Attorney via its attorney XXXX XXXX is a fraud upon the court and a blatant conspiracy to defraud me of justice Thus while Chase has claimed to be the holder of my original notes it has failed to surrender said notes to me as required after foreclosure of two of my properties This fact along with the sworn testimony of XXXX XXXX XXXX constitutes evidence that Chase lied that it was not the holder as claimed and that each foreclosure was fraudulent and a theft of my property It also constitutes proof that the DA s charges of fraud brought at Chase s behest are utterly baseless as Chase has never proven that it acquired said loans or suffered any loss Thus Chase and its attorney XXXX XXXX have conspired with DA XXXX XXXX and investigator XXXX XXXX to falsely arrest imprison and indict me without any basis IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THIS FRAUD I HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS AGAINST CHASE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I have been challenging Chase s standing to foreclose in the local courts for the last several years Chase has repeatedly failed to prove that it acquired any beneficial interest to the properties it has foreclosed upon or the properties it has threatened to foreclose upon Recently Chase had its attorney XXXX XXXX write to the district attorneys office claiming that Chase did not authorize the recording of various documents on the public record However I have proof that I did obtain authorization from chase based upon multiple private agreements that chase never responded to defaulted on and acquiesced to The District Attorney then had me arrested for filing false documents XXXX XXXX did not name the officer who supposedly claimed that I was without authorization nor did he supply the DA with an affidavit from a competent witness The DA falsely arrested me without a sworn affidavit from an officer of Chase He charged me strictly based on the letter from XXXX XXXX who is not a competent witness but was retained as the defense attorney on a suit brought by me against Chase for wrongful foreclosure illegal conversion and fraud The claims of fraudulent filings are exactly what I have been accusing Chase of as part of my civil litigation against them JPMorgan did execute un lawful foreclosures and then evictions without returning the original notes to me in violation of law and equity As it is not equitable for Chase to keep both the property and the note after a foreclosure see California Civil code 2941 The district attorney has contacted a tenant that I have living in a different property in the county and intimidated him to such a degree as to convince him to stop paying the rent This act by the DA was meant to deprive me of funding so that I would not be able to properly litigate the multiple litigations and experience a financial hardship The district attorney has also been meeting with Chase s attorney in the halls of the courthouse after the civil litigation proceeding to escalate the civil proceeding to criminal charges See attached criminal complaint This situation has caused me XXXX XXXX XXXX for years even after Chase has paid billions in illegal foreclosure settlements to the US government I want the CFPB to publish this description on consumerfinance gov so that others can learn from my experience What would be a fair resolution to this issue Withdraw the criminal complaint XXXX County California case No XXXX XXXX County California case No XXXX The CFPB should investigate each of Chase s foreclosures on my properties and others as there is compelling evidence cited herein that Chase does not have ANY of the notes on any of the properties it has foreclosed upon According to the un rebutted statement of the XXXX XXXX XXXX it is policy for banks to destroy notes The federal government which collects billions of dollars from banker s malpractice settlements must make these funds available to the consumers who have been defrauded by this malpractice The judicial branch of government must admit that widespread bank fraud has been perpetrated against American consumers and eliminate this practice In this case we ask that CFPB contact the public office of the XXXX County District Attorney to have them withdraw its criminal complaints against myself and other consumers actively litigating these important matters in civil court Step 4 Edit this

The party submitting this complaint is Borrower Spouse B for purposes of protection of personal information The Loan Service Provider LSP has unilaterally XXXX a fictitious legal framework over Borrower Spouse Bs financial responsibilities by applying an erroneous limited co signer repayment liability framework despite the terms of the Master Promissory Note MPN or contract expressly stipulating a joint Spousal Consolidation Loan SCL meant to create a unified contractual recognition of co borrowers derived from Borrower Spouse Bs and Borrower Spouse As individually borrowed loans By unilaterally transferring his role to one of co signer of a regular consolidation loan the LSP has not only prevented Borrower Spouse B from equally accessing the rights and benefits available to co borrowers under the terms of the joint contract he did sign but they have also imposed the limitations and full financial and legal burden for an individual loan he did not sign The LSP has thusly denied or prevented Borrower Spouse B from acting in any way equal to Borrower Spouse A under the terms of this spousal loan at the same time that they constantly and exclusively refer to a MPN for a joint SCL that was approved without any loans for Borrower Spouse B Borrower Spouse B has attempted to have himself released from this loan because of his lack of legal consideration but XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX doing business as XXXX XXXX XXXX and now Nelnet all LSPs are treated as a single entity under the terms of transference have all denied this request The signed MPN does not contain a section for a voluntary co signor as it was meant to provide for the consolidation of loans held by two separate but married borrowers A loan consolidation form for a single individual with a co signor was not submitted although it was an available option at the time In Section B Spouse Information the form expressly states Only complete this section if your spouse has eligible loans and you both wish to consolidate jointly If you complete Section B also include your spouses loan s in section D 1 and D 2 Your spouse must also sign and date item 38 in Section G Section F of the MPN also provides for treating both signatories to the contract as a single unit Section F further states If I am applying jointly with my spouse I further understand that my Federal Consolidation Loan will be fully discharged only if both of us qualify for discharge and may be partially discharged if only one of us qualifies for discharge The signed MPN was used specifically for consolidating loans held by both parties in a marriage and specifically states that the spouses information was to be filled in only if the spouses loan information was included in part D of the application The MPN was approved without any of the financial consideration due Borrower Spouse B but he has since been held financially and legally liable for the full amount that exclusively reflects Borrower Spouse As prior loans On XX XX 2017 Borrower Spouse A unilaterally and without consulting with or informing Borrower Spouse B requested a change in the repayment terms The change was processed by the LSP without consulting or seeking consent from Borrower Spouse B In a prior CFPB case requesting release the LSP did not address the issue of their own recognition of the fault in the MPN that had them treating Borrower Spouse B as a mere co signor instead of an equal borrower Instead they addressed his request to be released by stating that Borrower Spouse B s and Borrower Spouse As change in marital status does not affect his individual liability under the terms of the very same contract they are not honoring Borrower Spouse B never alleged or argued that the divorce between him and Borrower Spouse A should relieve him of any contractual duties The divorce was mentioned to explain the court ordered context of his being the sole payee over the history of the loan and the fact that despite the joint aspect of the loan Borrower Spouse B is denied access to or otherwise prevented by both the LSP and Borrower Spouse A from accessing financial legal protection tools and resources in addition to rights and benefits such as filing income tax deductions for the loan payments he has exclusively made Borrower Spouse A has unlawfully claimed this deduction totaling nearly 4000 00 to date because Borrower Spouse B has been denied the information necessary to file The LSP denied Borrower Spouse B his rights under any possible joint loan when they changed the terms of repayment without consulting with him or seeking his consent and while they continue to deny him full access to the account including disclosure documents and other communications While the unilateral change in repayment terms has already been addressed and reverted the conditions under which the provider permitted this and took action upon it remain and continue to be legally and functionally contrary to the signers intent and consent The LSP continues to deny the fault in the MPN imposing unilateral terms from a contract that does not exist ,Student loan

This is somewhat of a continuation of a complaint about BBVA Compass Bank Compass Bank had admitted to making errors and had apologized for them They had retraced the amount supposedly owed from 3300 00 down to 1200 00 dollars They admitted to taking a refund from the extended warranty and GAP policy The extended warranty was 2500 00 and the GAP was 350 00 a total of 2900 00 dollars 3300 00 minus 2900 00 is 420 00 Compass Bank also did not included my monthly payment made in XXXX of 2017 Monthly payments were at 270 00 dollars So if I take the remaining 420 00 minus 270 00 that would be 150 00 left as a remainder Also in the recent past I had placed extra money onto the monthly payment This paying above the regular monthly payment So that being 150 00 left of the remaining balance Yet I will stress upon this again that Compass Bank did not return my prescription medication Nor did they offer a refund partial refund or any compensation of any kind This medication s cost greatly outweighs the remaining balance of 150 00 by quite a bit ,Vehicle loan or lease

check deposited Under suspicion that this was fraudulent activity XXXX took action and informed XXXX that the other account she deposited the 2200 00 into was frozen so the proceeds could not be moved or withdrawn Our account was also frozen until this mess could be sorted out At this point I was contacted by my wife XXXX and made aware of what was going on I left work to meet her at the Capital One so that I could get a better understanding of what had transpired and what would be the resolution I was under the assumption and provided assurance from XXXX that we would not be liable for the fraud which my wife was victimized by and that once the matter was resolved our account would be no longer frozen XXXX said this kind of activity was not uncommon and he was confident that the check we were given to deposit would turn out bad He let us know that the matter would be turned over to the fraud department On Friday XXXX XXXX XXXX called the fraud department for Capital One but they had closed for the day They returned her call Monday XXXX XXXX and she spoke to someone in the fraud department that informed her that XXXX should not have shared the information regarding the other account nor made any assurances that we would not be held responsible for any portion of the losses due to the fraudulent activity The incident was explained to the fraud department then they gave us no expectations of what might occur next other than Capital One possibly holding us responsible for someone else s fraud Since the initial meeting with XXXX we have been unable to log in to access our accounts online We have a Capital One credit card which XXXX was trying to pay however our online access appeared to be suspended and she was provided a phone number to call Each time she called she was referred to the fraud department The credit card payment is past due and we have no means to pay online and do not receive paper statements Yesterday XXXX was finally able to log in and noticed that Capital One had debited our checking account for the amount of the bad check of 2400 00 which left the account overdrawn by 2200 00 XXXX tried to contact XXXX going by the branch and she was told he would be there today XXXX called the branch today and was told XXXX would not be in until this coming Monday She was told by a banker that they would call her back within an hour to discuss this after they could find out what was going on with the fraud department The banker never called back Unfortunately we do not have the banker s name She also tried to call the fraud department yesterday and left a message which went unreturned Capital One also charged the account 35 00 for the deposit of the bad check yesterday as well Later yesterday XXXX was able to view account transactions and noticed the balance had been credited for the 35 00 and the negative balance of 2200 00 was credited back resulting in a zero balance The account was also closed All we have are a few emails from the bank indicating we were overdrawn and we also have a Case Number XXXX which has something to do with their internal fraud investigation We went to the police department in XXXX Branch today and filed a report for the fraud and were provided incident number XXXX and met with Police Officer XXXX XXXX The phone number on the police officer s card is XXXX We were pretty much told there was nothing the police could do to assist us While we were at the police department all of our account activity was wiped clean and we could no longer view any transaction history We also went by a branch asking for a District Manager s contact information and were provided only an email address for a XXXX XXXX and when we tried to email them the email bounced back indicating no such address We have tried to work with the bank but they have not seemed willing or able to let us know any details as to what was going on The past few days they have not been returning calls or being available when previously telling us they would be We have concerns over how we are being treated as though we perpetrated the fraud when we along with the bank were victimized The bank however as previously informed by XXXX was successfully able to block the proceeds in the account in which the cash was deposited into and in addition XXXX the local branch manager was given the envelope with the remaining 200 00 to make Capital One whole However our account remains locked where we can not manage our credit card and our existing balance of 250 00 was inexplicably taken by the bank It makes no sense to us that we got no notification of this pending action nor why our funds would be taken by the bank when they had the deposit already secured from the other account ,Checking or savings account

I am filing this CFPB complaint my 3rd in the past 2 weeks documenting an ongoing set of issues regarding my current offer of a Mortgage Modification from OCWEN My contact within the Office of the Consumer Ombudsman has responded to my last complaints by providing a second extension to my deadline to execute the current Mortgage Modification offer as long as two conditions are met 1 that I return a signed copy of the document by XX XX XXXX 2 that I make my payment in the approximate amount of 2500 00 by when it s due in XX XX XXXX as I always have in the past On the first condition OCWEN is currently preparing answers to my questions that I anticipate I will receive in sufficient time to make an informed decision before the deadline for my signature I certainly hope so On the second condition however fulfilling it has proven much more difficult Up through my XX XX XXXX payment all of my trial period payments have been made on an automated basis which I set up with my Bank When I check on the XX XX XXXX however to make certain that the payment had gone out I discovered that it had not Upon contacting my Bank directly I learned that were unable to tell me why the payment had not been delivered and indeed whether it might still go out without any warning before it did Despite this professional shortcoming on my Bank s part however I did the only responsible thing I could to ensure that the payment was made on time which was to go to the bill pay section of OCWEN s website and attempt to follow through on the instructions to make my 2500 00 payment on time in XX XX XXXX on my own This was despite the fact that by doing so I could have made a duplicate payment in the end money which OCWEN would not have refunded me and which would have overdrawn my only checking account When I did however I encountered more evidence of OCWEN s tendency to issue two or more sets of contradictory instructions to its customers confusing them and putting them at risk Logging into the OCWEN website on the first page see screenshot it tells me that my Next Payment Amount Due is 0 00 which any reasonable person would interpret as meaning that their account was current and no payment was due Because it made no sense that it also said my next payment was due in XX XX XXXX however and more broadly their patterns of customer mistreatment I knew to take nothing at face value so I pressed on to Make a Payment After making the necessary selections to authorize a payment however I was then blocked in carrying it out by OCWEN s own system the error message explaining Sorry Right now we ca n t take a Standard Single E Payment because the account is 10 or more business days overdue But you can choose the Rush Single E Payment option from the Payments Page You can also make a payment by phone screenshot I then of course attempted to track down Rush Single E Payment looking through multiple screens but finding it was nowhere to be found no such option existed Again two sets of contradictory instructions creating confusion In looking for it however I did discover another error message stating IMPORTANT Because your account is past due we can only accept a payment s for the full reinstatement amount Click here for a Reinstatement Quote Once you go through this process you then learn that effectively OCWEN is claiming that I owe 7100 00 and will need to pay this amount in order to make any payment at all Except this is not a way forward even if I had all this extra cash laying around given that 1 it is only IF all four of my payments in the amount of 2500 00 XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX are ignored that I would actually owe this absurd and erroneous amount 2 even if I did pay it OCWEN would not count it against the 2500 00 I actually owe for my XX XX XXXX payment but rather against this other 7100 00 amount as though my Mortgage Modification offer had never existed Calling OCWEN which I also did on XX XX XXXX yielded the same result by phone that there was no amount in payment they would accept that was less than 7100 00 At this point it occurred to me that it was likely not my Bank at all that had failed in the making of my payment but rather that OCWEN had likely blocked the original automated payment as well with the same excuse and twisted logic I could only thus assume that the same would hold if I were to send OCWEN a check as well At this point I had exhausted my options to actually make a payment so I both called and emailed XXXX XXXX on XX XX XXXX as well complaining to him directly that his own company was keeping me from fulfilling his instructions While he had all day Friday XX XX XXXX to respond and nearly all of today Monday the XX XX XXXX as well I have heard nothing from XXXX XXXX about this situation nor has any resolution been provided by any other part of the Company as well ,Mortgage

Executive Summary This is a breach of contract complaint against Discover for refusing to honor their promise to this Complainant to substantially reduce the interest rate on their credit card from 23 to 12 on the Discover credit card ending in XXXX a promise made by the Discover representative on the telephone if this Complainant were to promptly send the monthly payment discussed in that call on XX XX XXXX via Priority mail instead of via 1st class mail an act which this Complainant did perform on a timely basis Total Claim Amount Based on 12 interest this claim is for 11000 00 that is for the sum of two items a The full credit of the card balance aXX XX XXXXof 6400 00 plus b All the payments made of 5100 00 as of XX XX XXXX since the card balance was fully paid at 12 interest by the monthly payment onXX XX XXXXper the XXXX spreadsheet of the Discover monthly credit card payments during the last 8 years that was sent to Discover by the CFPB with the other documents filed with this complaint as discussed in more detail in sections 2 and 3 below Card Balance Amount History at Key Dates The contract to reduce the interest was formed onXX XX XXXX This complainant and Discover have been in disagreement on the balance owed ever since During the 8 year interval to the present minimum payments have been made every month ranging in size from 250 00 per month in the first year to an average of about 140 00 per month during the last 6 months As explained in section 3 below an XX XX XXXXfile tracking the balance owed and a breakdown of each monthly payment into interest and debt reduction portions has been filed with the CFPB by this Complainant and a copy is being sent to Discover by the CFPB This XXXX file has two sheets the 1st is an actual history of the Discover statements typically showing a 23 interest rate and the 2nd is a Would Have Been history if 12 interest had been charged instead The 2nd sheet in the XXXX file also tracks the claim this complainant has against Discover in terms of the excess interest payments made since the balance was fully paid as ofXX XX XXXX on the card based on 12 interest The sections 2 and 3 below discuss the balances owed at both the 12 and 23 rates at the key dates of a XX XX XXXXwhen this Complainant sent a letter to Discover documenting this claim and as of b XX XX XXXXwhen the total amount owed was fully paid off based on the 12 interest rate being charged the point after which all the payments made after XX XX XXXX are fully refundable to this complainant 1 The Creation of the Contract The promise was made by the Discover representative during a phone call to this Complainant onXX XX XXXX when the balance on this card was 11000 00 and this Complainant has notified Discover of this breach with timely phone calls beginning in XX XX XXXX and in writing most recently in a XX XX XXXXletter 2 This is the last chance for Discover to honor the promise made on XX XX XXXX to lower the interest Had Discover agreed to honor the 12 rate retroactively to XX XX XXXXat the time they received a letter from this Complainant on XX XX XXXXthen the balance would have been adjusted down at that time to 3700 00 instead of keeping it at the 8900 00 balance that it was then and by agreeing that going forward only 12 would continue to be charged by Discover then the card would have been fully paid off about two years later that is by the XX XX XXXX monthly payment Instead there is a cash refund due of all the payments made by this Complainant sinceXX XX XXXXor 5100 00 as of now i e onXX XX XXXX that would not have been accumulated by Discover This CFPB complaint is the last chance for Discover to avoid litigation of this claim 3 The Monthly Statements XXXX file 9 year Recap The difference between the 8900 00 and the 3700 00 or 5200 00 as of XX XX XXXXis per the monthly XXXX schedule accounting document prepared by this Complainant and sent to Discover via this CFPB included with a copy of a more detailed version of this complaint being filed with the CFPB which the CFPB is sending to Discover The XXXX file Spreadsheet has the 1st of 2 sheets that a lists an 8 year breakdown to the present of the actual activity in every monthly Discover Card statement including the beginning and ending balances like the 8900 00 still owed onXX XX XXXX and how much of each payment was interest or principal or other activity consisting of only two small debits since XX XX XXXX That XXXX file also has the 2nd of 2 sheets that b re calculates the principal and interest amounts but at the lower amount of interest at 12 and a commensurate increase in the principal portion of each monthly payment that would have been additionally paid each month if starting onXX XX XXXX Discover had reduced the 23 rate effective retroactively 4 years from XX XX XXXX as well as the revised beginning and ending monthly balances like the 3700 00 that would have been in the statement at XX XX XXXXbased on 12 vs the 23 that actually was in the majority of the monthly statements sent from Discover up to the present 4 Discover did not respond to those breach notifications either in writing or with a phone call that is Discover never entered into any form of good faith negotiations with this Complainant to resolve their breach of the interest reduction telephonic agreement of 6 25 09 leaving this Complainant with no alternative but to file this CFPB complaint 5 The balance on this Discover Card was always company debt it never was the personal debt of this Complainant The specific details of the breach by Discover are a the 1st step was when a Discover representative called this Complainant inXX XX XXXXand made an interest rate reduction promise b during a collection call to this Complainants home regarding a monthly payment which had been inadvertently overlooked for about 21 days c in exchange for a promise by this Complainant to mail that payment via Priority Mail d specifically offering to reduce the interest rate from 23 to 12 and most importantly on e a company credit card balance that is for charges that were utterly and entirely owed by the company that was this Complainants employer never a personal debt owed by this Complainant This is a claim centered around a company debt that had steadily grown to the full availability on a revolving basis for charges directly incurred by that employer of this Complainant during the 7 years of this Complainants active employment that firm i e that began in XX XX XXXX and ended inXX XX XXXX 6 This was a Wrongful Interest Increase by Discover and Six Very Large Banks on Credit Card Predatory Loans Discover was one of seven very large banks that jointly made significant credit card loans over that seven year period to this Complainants employer all the time holding this Complainant personally joint and severally liable for the repayment of those credit card borrowings Discover and the other 6 banks did not perform the due diligence required of all banks that is Discover failed to access the public financial information published quarterly by the SEC concerning this Complainants employer the true debtor of those credit card loans Those public reports provided dozens of pages each quarter describing the flow of assets into the company a flow that was almost entirely provided by two persons 7 Why This Complainant Agreed To Be the Only Executive Jointly Liable for the Companys Debt This Complainant agreed to be jointly liable with the company that employed him as a condition of his employment agreement for a key executive position that was offered to him by those two persons who effectively controlled all the income producing assets of the company 8 The Agreement to be Personally Liable for Company Debts Was Based on Trust This Complainant made a judgment based assessment that a those two persons could be trusted to honor their business agreements i e that they were honorable persons and that b they together could easily afford to personally pay the entire total availability on the credit cards offered for the companys exclusive use by those seven very large banks and continue to provide the company with the asset inflows needed to sustain fiscally successful operations and company technology development 9 The Decision to Trust was a Mistake but The Assessment of The Ability to Pay Was Correct In retrospect this Complainant was wrong about the honorable intentions of those two persons or the lack thereof but not about their ability and willingness to provide the sizeable flow of assets that needed to be provided to the company during the full seven years of this Complainants employment there as well as during all of the subsequent years after XX XX XXXX and up to the present 10 The Banks including Discover were driven by Greed at the Expense of Judgment and Due Diligence Discover and the other banks did not competently fulfill their due diligence responsibilities they did not properly evaluate the risk of gradually advancing over 200000 00 in credit availability collectively over a 7 year period ending in XX XX XXXX to a company whose income producing assets were effectively controlled by those two other persons without requiring their personal guarantees in addition to requiring this Complainants joint and severable liability for the credit availability in excess of 200000 00 Discovers share of that total was 11000 00 11 Those two other persons were in control of this Complainant s employer because they were providing all of the companys key marketable technology and most of its financial day to day operating resources that were required over the long haul to fulfill the companys periodic business plans 12 The Wrongful and Fatal Due Diligence Error by Discover Since Discover and the other 6 banks negligently did not require those other two persons to guarantee the companys debts on any of the bank cards it therefore was wrongful for Discover to hold only this Complainant personally liable for this debt owed by his employer 13 This was a Predatory Credit Card Loan The Discover credit card debt that is the focus of this CFPB complaint that totaled a debt of 11000 00 on 06 25 09 was one of those predatory bank credit card loans to this Complainants employer 14 Why it was a Wrongful Predatory Loan This was a Predatory loan because Discover and six other large banks provided credit card total availabilities jointly to this Complainant jointly with only the company that employed this Complainant that greatly exceeded the ability of this Complainant to personally pay those debts should the company suddenly cease operations the precise definition of a Predatory Loan 15 This Complainant is also the Victim of a Fraudulent Transfer of the Income Producing Assets of His Employers Assets to Another Company In XX XX XXXX the company employing this Complainant suddenly ceased operations when the two persons who had controlled the income producing assets of that company quickly moved those income producing assets to another company a new company that they also controlled via a fraudulent asset transfer 16 In response Discover and the other banks suddenly increased the interest rate on the bank card debt s to 23 i e typically at least double what had been paid in previous years 17 Discover benefitted directly from the higher interest rates caused by the fraudulent transfer This caused this Complainant to solely and personally owe the 23 interest on the Discover card balance and personally to pay it but without employment income from the new company that now had the income from the fraudulently transferred assets and the new company also enjoyed all the following additional investments from the two persons in control of those assets which this Complainants former employer had enjoyed previous to the fraudulent transfer As a result Discover

I went to a Bank of America branch to talk about getting a home equity loan I described my situation in detail I needed money to renovate a home that my brothers and I had just inherited so that we could put it up for sale the house is held in a family trust BofA holds the existing first mortgage on the house I gave the banker a lot of information to get the paperwork started but I did not sign anything authorizing a credit check However the next day both my husband and I got notices from our credit monitoring service that our credit had been checked by BofA One day later a BofA rep called to get more info for the loan and in the course of that conversation I explained again why I needed the money She put me on hold for a while and then came back and told me that the first bank rep had made a mistake and BofA would not loan money for a renovation in order to sell a home I said I wanted to lodge a complaint and get the credit inquiry removed from our credit reports since there never was any chance that we would be getting a loan She gave me contact info for her supervisor and several days later I was able to reach him He was apologetic but when I asked why our credit was pulled before we d given authorization he did n t have a good explanation and when I said that I wanted the bank to contact the credit reporting agencies to get the loan inquiries removed from our credit reports he said he did n t think that was possible That s crazy If BofA checks our credit without written authorization when they do n t even offer loans for our particular situation then they should have to remove that credit inquiry from our credit reports so that it does n t affect us later on The supervisor was very nice and kept saying I promise this wo n t affect your credit but I do n t think I should have to rely on his promise I want that bogus inquiry removed On top of this the first banker misrepresented the loan costs to me when I was in her office in two different ways First she said that it had a introductory rate of 2 99 during the first year but much later at the end of our appointment she said that the 2 99 rate was not guaranteed for the first year and that it could vary When I tried to get the details of how it might vary she just kept saying Do n t worry it wo n t vary In addition she neglected to mention the Early Closure Fee for keeping the account fewer than 36 months that is described in the paperwork that arrived at my home a few days after our meeting despite the fact that I had been very clear about only needing the loan for about 4 6 months ,"Credit reporting, repair, or other"

I opted out of an Overdraft Protection program for my debit card account which explicitly states that they would decline the card should there be insufficient funds in the account and not charge an NSF fee Upon noticing a NSF charge I called the bank They referenced a Regulation E which explains that the opt out does not apply to recurring charges the definition of such was not adequately explained They refused to refund me the overdraft fee of 35 00 even for this first offense I mentioned that since my account is in negative balance and therefore can not close the account without paying the NSF fee I would let it become inactive The repercussions per the agent I spoke with would be another 50 00 in fees and then having a collection agency attempt to collect his amount In the meantime this would effect my credit score and I would not be allowed to open any other checking accounts This is quite a hefty fee to pay for a poorly worded policy that anyone could have been duped ,Checking or savings account

additional until we were up to date She then directed us to send these payments directly to Carrington Mortgage at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA By sending to this location we were advised that payment would be handled by an actual person so funds would be applied properly to our account We felt somewhat better despite foreclosure notices In XX XX XXXX we received our second statement This statement attached shows that we have an overdue payment of 3600 00 As directed by Carrington Customer Service we subsequently mailed our payment to the aforementioned address our regular payment 3400 00 plus an additional 500 00 with note on payment stub as directed to apply to overdue balance in check XXXX for 3900 00 However on XX XX XXXX we received the attached letter and our XX XX XXXX payment check marked PIF Included with our returned check was a letter that formally stated that our payment check was returned because the loan was paid in full We knew something was obviously wrong We called Customer Service on XX XX XXXX and were placed on hold at XXXX EST When a representative answered the call we were advised that our account could not be located by either our phone or our loan numbers We remained on hold until XXXX EST with no assistance received We subsequently called again on XX XX XXXX at XXXX EST we spoke with XXXX We briefed him on our situation At XXXX we were again placed on hold At XXXX he returned and he advised us that he needed to check the status of our account with his supervisor At XXXX he returned and apologized he informed us that he was waiving the late fee and we made payment over the phone in place of the returned check check XXXX The confirmation number given was XXXX Moving forward we were directed to continue sending our regular payment plus the additional 500 00 and as previously instructed to send to the XXXX XXXX address so funds could be applied properly XXXX also directed us to send the attached cease and desist letter to stop the foreclosure notices and threatening voicemails Our intention was never to stop all communications Please note the letter specifically states harassing correspondence and voicemails regarding the default and foreclosure on our mortgage and added at the close of the letter should you have any questions or need additional information please do not hesitate to contact us In addition we provided both our home phone number cell phone number and an accurate email address XXXX was very nice and extremely helpful However the phone calls stopped but the letters did not stop Our bank records consistently showed that our monthly checks were received and cleared on time However we were still receiving numerous notices In good faith we continued to send payments as well as additional funds through XX XX XXXX At this point the account was up to date and the letters finally stopped In XX XX XXXX we explored refinancing our loan with the company who originally held the mortgage on this home However when our credit scores were run we were advised us that our credit has been dramatically effected for some reason Subsequently we were unable to refinance at that time In early XX XX XXXX we called Carrington Mortgage Customer Service and spoke to XXXX We briefed her on situation She advised that we send a fax to Customer Research and request that they look into the issue A couple of weeks later a letter was received regarding this inquiry It stated that since the request was signed electronically they would not respond to the request Also in XX XX XXXX we again received a letter from Carrington Mortgage stating they had not received our payment However our bank records showed that the payment check XXXX had cleared on XX XX XXXX To avoid further discrepancies on XX XX XXXX we went to our bank XXXX XXXX and requested assistance We inquired about setting up an ACH transfer to be assured payments continued to be made on time However we were told that Carrington Mortgage is unfortunately not in the XXXX XXXX system approved for ACH transfers We then opted to have the bank representative XXXX set up a XXXX XXXX automatic bill pay on our account It was set so that the payment check would be sent out no later than the 10th of every month directly from XXXX XXXX Starting in XX XX XXXX our payments were made utilizing bill pay directly from XXXX XXXX so we have a record of all payments made It worked well until XX XX XXXX when the mortgage increased to 3500 00 We received notice in late XX XX XXXX that payment was not made However our bank records showed that the check cleared on XX XX XXXX 3400 00 We subsequently returned to the bank in person on XX XX XXXX to assure that the payment amount was adjusted to 3500 00 The XX XX XXXX payment cleared on XX XX XXXX Since previous payments were made through the automatic bill pay without incident for 10 months we assumed payments would be back on track In XX XX XXXX an overdue payment amount of 140 00 appeared on our Carrington Mortgage Statement We believed this was due to the XX XX XXXX increase in payment so check XXXX was sent for 140 00 to resolve this balance However unfortunately due to an error made in the XXXX XXXX system our XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX payment amounts reverted back to 3400 00 We were unfortunately unaware of this error The foreclosure notices started again This brings us to the present and the conference call mentioned earlier Approximately 21 months after our XX XX XXXX conversation with XXXX the accounting practices utilized by Carrington Mortgage were fully explained to us by XXXX in XX XX XXXX During this phone conference it was stated that despite the direction given by XXXX in XX XX XXXX payments that are considered to be partial are actually placed in an unapplied funds bucket by Carrington Mortgage until the following month As it was explained a portion of those funds are then applied to previous month to complete that month but subsequently making the preceding month short Unfortunately in our case based on poor customer service given in XX XX XXXX this process became a vicious cycle in our account twice XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX and XX XX XXXX XX XX XXXX In the first instance we had been told there would be allowances made due to the roll over transition from XXXX and in the second we were relying on our bank to follow our written directive to increase the payment amount an increase of what amounts to approximately only 50 00 During our discussion with XXXX it was asked why a customer service phone call or letter was not received actually explaining this process It could have been very easily rectified She advised that there was not a phone number on record for the account Even though the cease and desist letter she referenced from XX XX XXXX specifically provided our contact information and asks for contact regarding any other questions or concerns As previously noted the request was only intended to cease and desist the harassing correspondence and voicemails regarding the default and foreclosure on our mortgage XXXX advised that in order to reinstate communications we would need to fax another letter That letter is attached herein We have also provided XXXX with our home phone number and cell phone number again During our conference call XXXX was adamant that Carrington Mortgage had done nothing wrong and the errors were ours solely We disagree and the impact to our credit and our good financial standing must be rectified ,Mortgage

Most current Experian Credit Bureau has once again listed and allowed under Collections a Fraudulent Account that has already been Investigated and Removed Deleted by all the three credit bureaus which are XXXX XXXX and Experian Experian Credit Bureau has allowed a XXXX XXXX named XXXX ie Creditor XXXX Account XXXX in the amount of 6400 00 to be re submitted by another XXXX XXXX is quite Illegal and unethical as this account should have been completely Deleted and Voided This account had already been investigated and removed deleted and yet it is being put back on I submitted three times the many many legal documents to validate my claim that it was indeed an Illegal Fraudulent Account The next account that continues to appear on my Experian Credit Report is the Creditor XXXX Account Number XXXX in the amount of 700 00 This account was also removed and deleted from XXXX and XXXX Credit Bureau Reports after they conducted their investigation and contacted the XXXX Company yet Experian Credit Report refuses to remove them I have also submitted via Fax and via U S Mail all the documents showing that XXXX also continues to violate my rights as well as Experian Credit Bureau as the Federal Trade Commission Rules and Laws validates this claim Experian Credit Bureau also has my credit report locked up to the point that only one individual who is a Supervisor who works in the Special Fraud Department is the only person who is allowed to make any changes as other Experian Employees have told me that they can not make any changes even if they work in that same department This is most unethical unprofessional and illegal as I have tried to dispute the XXXX Account like 9 times now and I can not get them to remove delete the XXXX Account The XXXX Account is tremendously affecting my credit and they too have violated my rights by not reporting my payments as they should have been Twice now Experian Credit Bureau has removed deleted XXXX from my credit report only to put it back on again This XXXX Creditor did not give my credit for my payments and claim I did not make payments for almost an year which is just plain insane If you take a good look at my Payment History You will see that I have always made my payments on time for all accounts and XXXX would have not been no different I should not be responsible for the billing errors that that made and then wanted me to pay for it I finally decided to Settle this account and believe it or not but XXXX actually claims I made no payments in the months that I settled the account which does not make any sense Plus even after I settled the account in XX XX XXXX XXXX continued to charge me way into the months of XXXX XXXX When I brought this to the attention of Experian Credit Bureau s Special Fraud Dispute Supervisor that does not like me as we landed up having our arguments as I disapproved her work ethics and she has changed other things on my report that were not there before as I will explain This Special Fraud Dispute Supervisor has taken complete control of my Experian Credit Report to the point that no one has access to my records and no one but She can make changes This is unacceptable and totally unbelievable that an employee of Experian would do this but it has happened to me and this is unacceptable I even tried contacting the CEO of Experian but I was unseccessful in reaching anyone Experian removed these errors for XXXX but I had already copied the files for each month and I submitted this to Experian Credit Bureau but this Supervisor refused to help me and let XXXX Creditor do whatever they wanted to me as not even the documents I sent helped me And those documents clearly state that XXXX continued to charge me up to six months after we settled the account I fact her exact words were People make little mistake and we can forgive them This is not right And the last thing that is going on with my Experian Report is the fact that most of my XXXX Loans with XXXX were all taken care of and all was good and now most of them state that they are not cleared They have a big question mark on them This is an abusive of power and it is affecting my ability to access decent credit from Lenders and not only that but is it affecting my Credit Scores All my XXXX Loans have been paid in full and they should all read the same just like they used to years ago before i started working with that one particular Supervisor Experian Credit Bureau should not be doing what is is doing to me as it is against the law If XXXX and XXXX were able to conduct their investigation and validate with the company then I do not understand why I am being punished by Experian Credit Report The Settlement Agreement clearly states in black and white that this account is forever VOID and NULL and Closed And then it states my credit report will reflect this change Yet because I offended one individual because I choice to speak up for myself she got offended Again it is not my fault that XXXX did not credit my account for my payments as I pay my debts I have sent all legal documents for all accounts in question like up to three times now and I can not continue to keep doing this as it cost me money to send all these documents over and over again Experian Credit Bureau needs to abide by Our Federal Trade Commission Laws My Consumer and Constitutional Rights are being abused and violated and I need this to stop Experian Needs to stop allowing Creditors that have already been removed for being Fraudulent Accounts to be put back on my credit report as that is against the law ,"Credit reporting, repair, or other"

XX XX XXXX I checked my credit report and noticed that a navy federal credit card was opened in my name back in XX XX XXXX and had a balance of XXXX Before I even noticed about the account I had been receiving phone calls from random strangers who would n t identify themselves but knew all of my information including my address social security number and banking information including security passwords They used dead end numbers to contact me telling me I owe them debts and if I did n t pay I would be taken to court which turned up to be fraudulent The account had been being used time for time according to my report When I called Navy federal about the account I mentioned that I called my local police department to report identity theft along with freezing my credit reports instead of helping me they deflected my concerns and took it upon themselves of telling me that I should change account numbers and get a new credit card number I mentioned to them that I never received a credit card at all and never got billing statements even though I have never gone paperless for any of their statements which was confirmed by a customer service rep This loan amount never appeared on my NFCU app until after the first phone call about the fraudulent credit card was made to the fraud dept What is more crazy is I looked at the billing statement paper that was given to me it also shows security flaws These security flaws expose the credit card information associated with the account and it also shows my personal access number which makes it seem like I am the owner I noticed the card was named after my personal code word which I found to be a little crazy I called four more times after that on the same day and when I attempted to find out how this credit card was opened what address the credit card and billing statements were sent to and if it had a pin number associated with it with these obvious red flags of a fraudulent credit card account I have been given the run around because if I were the owner I would have known this information to begin with and would not have even called about the account in the first place The last agent I spoke with explained to me that I could shut down the account as they investigate this but they have not done an investigation all they have done is after 15 days of not paying the monthly bill the credit card account was put in default and sent to their collections department who has been doing deducting money from a joint savings account that s between my spouse and I and using that to pay the credit card back without any formal consent According to their credit card terms and agreement the account will be in default after 60 days of non payment but as way for them to not take responsibility for their recklessness and security negligence this fraudulent account was placed in default after 15 days again violating their own terms and agreement contract The only way I found this out was by checking my NFCU app and saw that this money was transferred without any notification thus breaking the protocol written in their credit card terms and agreement as it states that the authorized user is giving them permission to access and take money from all other accounts with NFCU to pay the delinquent account but since my spouse and I were unaware of this fraudulent account until receiving my free annual credit report we DID NOT give NFCU permission to access and take money from our accounts for this fraudulent account The bank claims they have insurance to protect themselves from things like this but they keep telling me I need to file a claim within thirty days from when it happened and it will be resolved How can it be resolved if this fraudulent activity had been going on for over a year How can I challenge this activity when I m challenging the whole entire account that is n t mine to begin with The bank insurance should allow them to clear the fraudulent account out of my name and I can move on from this crazy experience The bank claims I completed a phone application to get this card if this is true where is my signature at They also mentioned in there card terms and agreements disclosure the card is not valid in less my signature is on the back of this card and if this is true then the bank its self is going against its disclosure agreement I have documentation to back up my claims and I will continue the battle to get rid of this fraudulent activity that NCFU has allowed even though they have been sued already ,Credit card or prepaid card

This is regarding a private student loan from XXXX XXXX that was taken out more than 4 5 years ago which is beyond the statue of limitations for a private student loan that was not secured by the

A woman answered the phone and said Processing can I have your case number I asked her for her name She did not give me her name and said I need your claim number I asked her for the name of the company she was with She did not give me her company name and instead said I ca n t tell you anything without your case number I told her that federal and state regulations required her to tell me who I was speaking with if this was an attempt to collect a debt She suddenly knew my name I m assuming from a caller ID match on her side and forwarded my call without giving me any information about who I was talking to what the company name was or if this was a debt collection attempt At that point a man picked up the line and identified himself as XXXX I asked XXXX what company he worked for He said that he did n t need to tell me I said that he did because state and federal regulations required that he tell me He laughed and placed me on hold When he came back he said that the company s name was Zenco I asked him to spell it but he refused I informed him that thus far nobody at his company had performed their debt collection attempt according to regulations if this was even a debt collection attempt He yelled that You are in no position to bargain because your wages are going to be garnished and then hung up the phone At that point I tried calling back XXXX but every time someone picked up the phone they either hung up the line immediately or transferred me to a voicemail box that did not even have a name associated with it So I was left to assume what this message I was left by XXXX XXXX was about I looked up my credit report and saw an old debt that this call might have been about because to this point nobody had even told me what the debt was how much it was or anything that I could use to verify if this was even valid I decided to call the number listed on my credit report The company named on the credit report was XXXX XXXX XXXX I spoke with a helpful woman named XXXX who listened to exactly what I went through with Zenco She even verified what I owed what the account had been and everything I needed to validate that this was a genuine item that needed my attention She put me on hold for a while so she could go discuss everything I had told her with someone When she came back she told me that I needed to go through Zenco to settle my debt I asked if I could just settle through her because she had treated me like a human being and I would rather just deal with her since she was already on the line with me but she said that Zenco had the account at this point and XXXX XXXX XXXX used Zenco for this purpose So she told me to call Zenco at XXXX and ask to speak to a manager I called Zenco at XXXX and a woman answered the phone saying Zenco how may I help you I asked to be transferred to a manager as instructed by XXXX She transferred my call to a voicemail box that had a man s voice but the man did not state his name or position So I called back Zenco at XXXX and the same woman picked up I told her that I had just spoken with XXXX XXXX XXXX and wanted to speak with someone regarding settlement of a debt She transferred me to a woman named XXXX I will admit that XXXX was a nice person who treated me with respect and was very forthcoming about the situation There was no talk of legal proceedings garnishments or anything I was starting to have my doubts about whether those initial statements left on the voicemail message from XXXX XXXX were even truthful After XXXX and I verified the debt and details of it I told her that I wanted to settle the debt XXXX calculated a settlement amount and we reached a mutually beneficial agreement to resolve the debt However despite how well XXXX performed as an ethical and reasonable debt collector I felt that it was necessary to file this complaint with the CFPB because the initial practices of Zenco were not very ethical or humane and quite possibly illegal In addition how is Zenco able to collect on a private student loan debt that has gone past the 4 5 year statue of limitations I finished my degree program in XX XX XXXX and it s XX XX XXXX That is 9

Please see the following message I sent to the company XXXX XXXX For 2 years I had autopay set up but that was somehow turned off due to an error on their website they do n t claim responsibility for There was no reason I would use autopay for 24 p ayments in a row then disable it Once I was made aware of the late payment I checked my account which was still showing everything was fine and payment should have been extracted Letter sent to XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this letter This afternoon I had my credit report pulled and discovered that a late payment was reported in XXXX XXXX for my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I want to first start off by saying that in over 2 years of holding my mortgage with you I was never late on a single payment In fact I was pre paying the principal down 150 00 per month and making extra payments on the account Here are my payment details XXXX XXXX XXXX payment is pulled out on XXXX of every month XXXX XXXX XXXX payment is pulled out on XXXX of every month XXXX XXXX XXXX payment is pulled out on XXXX of every month including multiple double payments as my loan kept showing that my schedule payments were not being processed even though autopay was there it kept showing balances owed and I was in fear of my account payment being late There was clearly an error with something in the system that was out of my control but I was logging on and trying to supplement it the best that I could I felt paying extra would secure me from any late payments At some point in XXXX something happened on my account but no one can tell me why the auto draft was turned off I had setup auto draft during the entire stint of my loan but in XXXX of XXXX it was turned off I am unsure if this was an error on my part or an error on the XXXX website What we concluded was that on XXXX XXXX XXXX my mortgage payment was charged 1400 00 On XXXX XXXX XXXX a new figure was added and a charge of 1400 00 was assessed I am assuming the error came in that this was supposed to be the new auto draft payment but was entered in as a one time payment I never knowingly or would never intentionally turn off my auto draft and elect to pay monthly by logging into the account I believe it was either made in error or there was an error on the XXXX website The website is thoroughly outdated and not very simple in electing payment options It very well could be that this was my mistake but no one has been able to tell me that I logged on my computer and decided to cancel it Its highly likely I replaced my auto pay with a one time payment but I was never called or warned about that move I feel that after 2 years of doing auto pay it should have been noted as out of the ordinary that such an event would take place This is where I feel that any human that is looking at my account must understand there was miscommunication on the website with payment instructions and something odd was going on Around that same time I was in the midst of traveling to Virginia to be with my father XXXX XXXX who passed away on XXXX XXXX XXXX from his second battle of XXXX XXXX In that time period you can certainly understand that checking the mortgage payment auto draft was the least of my worries In the coming months we prepared his funeral had to sell his home and take care of his final wishes and expenses The other issue I had was that during this whole ordeal I was also refinancing my home to save on a lower interest rate In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX a total of XXXX payoff requests were sent to finalize my loan There were struggles there which pushed back the loan process and ultimately led to my loan carrying on months longer than it should have There is no one to blame but in all of those moves not one mention was made that my account had not been making its monthly mortgage payments In this mix up I feel it was possible there was miscommunication on both ends I wasnt receiving notices I was checking my account and seeing that a balance wasnt owed every so I had thought my account stood in good order Everything appeared fine I believe this was even the case XXXX came along because I do not recall any representative calling or any notice to say that I was on the edge of missing my payment In fact I had a conversation with XXXX and Equifax on XXXX XXXX XXXX and I was told my account was in perfect order I was told at the time that no payment was due and I had a month where payment was submitted late It breaks my heart to know that if someone took the time to work with me as a client maybe this could have been avoided It wasnt until after the payment was already late that in XXXX I received noticed I thought right away this must be a mistake and called XXXX to see what the issue was I was told that at some point my auto pay was cut off and that I was 6 days late on my payment but no one could tell me how or why it was cut off the assumption just was that it was my fault I went right away and while still on the phone I paid my bill In talking to the representative still he understood it was nothing more than a technological error and he told me there would be no penalty to my credit and he was happy to waive the fee that was going to be assessed He said since it was caught so soon and taken care of right away he could tell by my fair intentions and that there was money in escrow on top of the fact that I submitted payment right then and there on the phone there wouldnt be a hit on my credit score and everything would be fine The representative assured me of that I didnt document this anywhere because I took his word for it and now it hurts me to see that in the end that he failed to own up to his end of the bargain I do have one other problem in that it seems there was an error with my payment and escrow amounts being much higher than normal I received an escrow refund of almost 3000 00 after my tax bill was paid and this money couldve easily been taken from my escrow to pay the balance owed This error wasnt because of financial difficulties in meeting my obligations but 100 based on a lot of things going on in my life and the errors made on my part with the payment structure of the XXXX XXXX system I realize I made a mistake in failing to be completely thorough but I do feel I was let down by technology of the payment website and the overcomplicated system My payment history should speak for itself as I worked exclusively with auto pay and made additional principal with you had been spotless Mistakes do happen but when the company truly cares for you that should be taken care of as part of the cost of doing business with XXXX over another firm In fact there was an error with my refinanced mortgage I had incorrectly input the account number for my draft and when the new mortgage company tried to draft it they could not My first mortgage payment was going to be late Right away I was on the phone with them and they took care of it They wrote me back saying that they understood it was a mistake I was brand new to the account and they could see that the money is in my account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and it was nothing more than a mistake I feel thats the meaning of customer service and I would hope as a leader in mortgages XXXX would be willing to treat me with that same respect I m not only embarrassed by this black m ark on my record but it s now hurting my ability to buy a new home for me and my XXXX XXXX In completing loan paperwork today I was crushed to find out my credit score was dropped to under XXXX XXXX to be exact That is a very harsh penalty for missing a payment by 6 days especially when it was nothing more than a mistake at most and highly possible it was an error in technology This was the first time in over 2 years in working with XXXX that I had any such issue and I would hope that the relationship we had and you wanting to serve your customers best that you would have it in your heart to reverse the credit reporting late payment on my mortgage account I would be extremely grateful if you could honor this request to remove the late payment entry from my credit report It would help me immensely in securing my loan and allowing us to buy a home we have been dreaming about I started my relationship with XXXX as you were recommended to me by the builder of my condo Without his referral this would be a relationship that was never started No one ever knows what the future may hold and there could be possible business for us together down the line Completely shutting out a customer and leaving such a mark especially for something so little has equally tough implications on XXXX just with the thought of potential business lost in the future If rates were competitive and some of the great features of XXXX were still available Id even be happy in seeking a loan with you again on my upcoming purchase The sad harsh truth is that without this being removed from my credit score I will be unable to close on the house in time and we will miss out on an amazing opportunity we are so happy about I truly am begging you to see this as a human being who can understand the situation I was in the extreme difficulty of losing my father at an age way too young and the simple technological mishaps that led to the late payment If I simply didnt have the money or was unable to pay I would understand and deserve the penalty I am in a sound financial decision and have spent many years working to have great credit Its a shame and honestly unfair that a 6 day late payment which again only happened in some sort of error could taint my record and take away something so precious to me I am closing on a home on XXXX XXXX XXXX and I am requesting this be looked into and handled immediately I will explore all necessary avenues to ensure that is the case I will work diligently to get this taken care of and will continue to work every day on this to get it rectified as I truly believe in my heart this is the right thing to do If I were at fault 100 or didnt have the funds I wouldnt be asking for your help I am asking out of the kindness of your heart and as a client for over 2 years please help me out as a courtesy and remove this late payment from my credit score It doesnt match the total body of work that I have put together over many many years and with it being so reason on my credit score its completely demolishing my credit score Please contact me immediately if we can discuss this matter together My number is XXXX XXXX

someone gifts money to me I need to get a gift letter signed by the gifter screen shots of the wire transfer and 2 months of their bank statements it didnt occur to someone to TELL ME that I could only have a certain percentage of it in gift money Is this just a new thing that they came up with on their own to mess with me I am THEN told that they want me to take money out of my 401k to use as a down payment as a condition to closing Who do they think they are to tell me that I have to take money out of my 401k CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN the logic in that to me I have this cash sitting there that I need to close but I am just going to ignore that and go borrow out of my 401k and use THAT money instead forget that I have to pay an additional 10 penalty on that AND it takes 2 weeks to process it And I told them from DAY 1 that I could NOT take ANY money out of my 401k for 2 reasons 1 is that there is already a loan out of it from putting money down on the house I just sold and 2 as part of my divorce temporary orders I am prohibited from dissolving any assets especially my 401k Not to mention THIS MAKES NO SENSE I am feeling sad that common sense isnt very common it seems I ask if they can just use the gift money as my credit card payoffs and use the 71000 00 that was put into my account due to my own house closing to use as the downpayment I am told NO XXXX calls me and tells me that his boss is with the underwriters and is trying to work something out He asks if the gift money can be considered what I used to pay off all of my debt and use the money from the sale of the house as my closing money and they told him that they would not Not COULD not but WOULD not A while later XXXX calls and says that one solution is that if I have a wealthy relative who will gift me an ADDITIONAL 22000 00 then I wont have to come up with any of the money on my own ARE YOU KIDDING ME It is XX XX XXXX Two months and one week since I started this horrendous process that has stressed me out more than I have ever been stressed out in my life For the last 3 weeks I can hardly sleep and I can hardly force myself to eat I feel weak and sick I am worried about the seller of the home and I am worried about myself I am sitting in limbo living out of a hotel room since XX XX XXXX not easy with BIG dogs who need exercise The home seller is living in limbo I cant make any plans more than a day out because I have no idea what is going on and where I will be Do I need to drive my stuff to XX XX XXXX Hire a moving van Do I need to give it up and just stay living in XXXX for the rest of my life If the loan all falls through I will have lost 5000 00 and I need to find out how to recover that AND I am going to need a place to live Because I thought it was temporary I was going to keep working where I am while I use up my accrued vacation and comp time to make renovations to the house put in a fence etc I am not going to go live with family if it is not indeed a temporary place to stay The 5000 00 I stand to lose does not even include the XXXX week to stay at the hotel until things are fixed and the XXXX day to eat out during lunch and dinner Every day I wake up and think surely TODAY will be the day Can anyone EVER close on a house with Chase Bank that isnt independently wealthy How do they stay in business Is this ANY way to treat customers I had my last mortgage there I have checking and savings accounts there I have been a good customer What did I do to deserve this Is it really nice to change the rules in the middle of a game SEVERAL TIMES and expect the players to just adapt Or even to mind read the rules so they can comply with them It is OK to leave me my family the seller and her family ALL SITTING IN LIMBO living out of boxes while waiting for answers or was it to make up new rules just to make sure the loan was denied Is this really any way to treat customers Who changes underwriters a week before a loan is to close and then the new underwriter rejects EVERYTHING that the previous one accepted and then does n t share pertinent information while making ridiculous demands What kind of company allows their computers to stay inoperable for such a long time with such time sensitive matters Who in their right mind thinks that it is OK to ask me to ignore money sitting in my account and then bear the expense and added time of taking money out of my 401k that is SUPPOSED to be used for my retirement Am I the ONLY one who thinks that is the most ridiculous thing that they have ever heard of I have never had to endure something like this in my life and the stress is unbearable ,Mortgage

Re XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 1100 00 I have disputed the issue with the reporting company but have not received a final response other than what shows on my credit tracking apps I could argue that several of the reasoning options listed above would suffice as a grounds for complaint ie did not get proper help over the phone problem with statement of dispute investigation took too long etc and I could probably add a few more not listed I am frustrated My complaint is against TransUnion for not addressing my dispute with original creditor collection agency with proper ethics and advocacy on my part I have disputed this balance several times now with TransUnion because the original creditor will not comply with requests for itemized and detailed invoices and line item charges which I have requested multiple times from collection agency who now has this account My purpose in requesting these was to instigate an affidavit of unauthorized charges on this original account I get nowhere with collection agency and in fact am told that they are only required to provide basic and satisfying information to validate the debt to the reporting credit bureau I know it is my account however the question is accuracy of amount due because of these unauthorized charges My complaint with original creditor is that these unauthorized charges are the result of retailer in this case XXXX revolving card not verifying my identity with proper ID at time of purchase therefore allowing unauthorized person s to charge to my account Twice in XX XX XXXX attempts were made with representative XXXX at collection agency XXXX XXXX but told each time that his agency has sent required docs to reporting agencies I requested to haves them sent to me as well and was told that I should get them in 7 10 days I had even sent via mail a request for documents and NOT EVEN a response back Nothing At this time this is neither here nor there now as I have moved past trying to get the collection agency to provide my requests and now see that my time is wasted dealing with the collection agency as I was getting nowhere Therefore I directed my complaint to TransUnion in the hope that their investigation would prompt collection agency to provide accurate account information TransUnion has a responsibility in proper investigating and in reporting to me the timely status of the investigation instead of the dry and customary meets FCRA requirements I have disputed this twice now three if you count the initial phone call dispute with TransUnion and do n t even get the courtesy of a letter or email to notify me of status or findings I am very frustrated and feel as though I have no rights in this matter and have gotten nowhere in following recommended protocol and steps for resolution This has been an education for me and I have learned that the reporting bureaus do n t have to substantiate anything except known public record type of information to satisfy the proof of debt The credit process has been made to be a black or white issue with reporting and follows a general set of guidelines and protocol therefore making it a laborious process to communicate situations and disputes that are not always black or white and do require more ethical investigation than just the standardized proof of debt validation On top of this it has easy to see the close relationship that the bureaus keep with the lenders and creditors that works against the borrower in many cases when a person such as myself has to fight for my right to obtain information and request dispute resolutions For final disposition on this matter I request that this be removed from my report with TransUnion as I see no other viable or satisfying solution and have exhausted all resources ,"Credit reporting, repair, or other"

To Whom It May Concern I asked for a mortgage from Wells Fargo for refinancing purposes It not only took 5 months for them to review and look at the documents even I was warning them the time was passing their employees are not aware of what each other do they did mistakes when submitting the loan requests and restarted the process therefore After all these mistakes they tried to charge me fees to extend my mortgage rate lock every 15 days I said that they may not move so slowly and charge another 250 00 every 15 days to keep the rate locked Then they threatened me with canceling the mortgage process if I do not lock the rate I also said I will not pay for any appraisal costs until my file is approved I said the appraisal has to be done last in the process so I do n t pay appraisal fee for nothing They not only charged me the appraisal fee of 670 00 which is outrageous for a condo appraisal anyways but also pushed me to pay 250 00 extra every 15 days to extend the rate lock Then I said that they need to refund my appraisal fee and I will not proceed Then they said they found some XXXX being mentioned in the condo association document This is why they will not do mortgage This is an old condo from XXXX in XXXX and there are so many other condos financed there I said that is fine that we do not move with the process after 5 months and asked them to refund the appraisal fee charge I have all the emails and conversations recorded The issue is 1 Well Fargo may not push the customers to pay 250 00 every 15 days to keep the mortgage rate to be locked if the customer says Let it float until we close They are doing deceiving practices and abusing the consumer Their initial Fair Faith Mortgage Cost Estimate document did not match what they finally sent to me due to those lock rate extension fees 2 If the customer asks that appraisal fee will only be done after all the process is completed to make sure everything is approved they may not charge my credit card without my consent as I know they play these tricks I clearly said the appraisal may only be done as a last step in the process You need to help me to penalize these guys who take advantage of the customers and run like wild West I will sue them Thanks Regards XXXX XXXX,Mortgage

During XX XX XXXX I XXXX closed my business checking bank account at XXXX and switched to XXXX During XX XX XXXX I called up Citizen One Auto Finance requesting a form to be set up with auto payment through the new bank account I was sent a form to fill out which I did However at the beginning of XX XX XXXX sometime between the XXXX and the XXXX I received a call from Citizen One Auto Finance notifying me that my account is past due I immediately paid the balance and requested again to be set up with auto payment I received another auto payment form which I filled and mailed on XX XX XXXX To my great disappointment and frustration I received another call on XX XX XXXX notifying me again that the account is past due At this point I started to ask questions After spending 6 hours on the phone and speaking with over 10 customer representatives I finally found out that the auto payment request form which was mailed on XX XX XXXX was only received on XX XX XXXX a fact which I find hard to believe Additionally I was informed for the very first time that it takes up to 2 billing cycles for the auto payment to be implemented Had I known this fact I would have continued to send checks until I would see the auto payments coming out of the bank Later on that day I discovered from another representative that both applications were rejected because a letter from my bank specifying that I m a signor on the account was not provided along with the form This requisite was not communicated to me during the 2 phone calls in which I requested the auto payment set up Most importantly this requisite was not listed what so ever on the instructions of the form itself The form does say however that if it is incomplete it would be sent back to me That never happened And when I called for the second time for the auto payment set up no one informed me that my first application was rejected or the reason I feel that Citizen One Auto Finance was being deceitful and was withholding information to gain more late fees and hurt my credit score I had to spend an entire day calling dozens of times and being told at times actual lies to discourage me to file a complaint with their credit bureau in order to discover the real reason the auto payment was not implemented ,Consumer Loan

There are a couple things I d like to touch upon one I know what over draft protection is But banks find it very easy for to just collect the fee for transferring money when swiping a debit card They tell me the fees are regulated but one bank charges each time the card is swiped and another charges one fee at the end of the day and that same bank will charge XXXX as well every once in a while I asked when I set up this account that since I have overdraft protection that it only work on checks and eft and not on everything including debit card swipes inserts and was told yes it could but because of the type of account I have that it couldnt be set up like that until a year after the account was opened More than a year later I found out that was a lie and that they couldnt set it up that way Bait and switch much Aside from this numerous reps have given me confusing information regarding why charges to my cards will go thru without sufficient funds being in my account one said recurring charges will always be processed no matter what and so i said a recurring charge comes thru on a expired or a card number reported as lost or stolen and on a closed account will go thru Their response was yes OK another response was its at the banks discretion to either pay or approve the recurring charges once they are presented to the bank because they could have been processed at a previous time One charge I was questioning was a recurring charge in which the bank approved and was on my account pending and I thought I had like 4 00 in my account and was denied for a 3 00 purchase Come to find out the charge was pending for XXXX on an account that had XXXX in the checking and negative XXXX dollar in my overdraft account Mind you this charge was pending and had n t posted to my account but still prevented me from making my purchase of 3 00 I had called in and was confronted over the phone by someone who was n t very helpful in answering my questions regarding other recurring charges that were denied but for some reason this one for XXXX was approved She just didnt know how to answer this concern but to keep repeating the same thing its at the banks discretion to either pay or approve the recurring charges once they are presented to the bank because they could have been processed at a previous time And when asked when this one was processed she responded this morning only I asked her then why did another recurring charge this week get declined and I said XXXX but was mistaken for the actual amount of XXXX But it still showed a point And as well as a recurring charge for my cell bill which was charged like clockwork every month was declined to which she responded about the banks discretion again I have recurring charges being charged every month cell XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX All of which has been declined previously because of no money in my account as well as the one in question numerous times So why is this one and not the others special The reply of the banks discretion again Someone slap the record player the record is scratched and it keeps repeating I finally had enough of the repeating of the same thing and I hung up Another issue which I read is pending against them about them opening accounts without my approval When I got the account I wanted only a Checking account and was explained that it was a package deal and that all checking accounts come with a savings account Now I know why ,Bank account or service

Chase along with other banks have a deposit cut off time For Chase this cut off is XXXX EST XXXX CST and deposits made after this time are considered next day deposits The problem with this cut off time is that if a transaction like ACH payment hits the account after this cut off and causes the account to become negative the consumer is not given the opportunity to deposit funds to avoid being penalized with an overdraft fee If the bank has a deposit cut off time then it should do the same for transactions posting to the account How is this okay or fair to charge a fee without giving the consumer a fair opportunity to deposit funds to avoid getting fees I voiced my concern to Chase by opening up a complaint which I was told I d hear back from a manager within 2 business days and it has now been 3 weeks with no contact from anyone at Chase Yes in an ideal world if you know a bill payment is going to be taken out of your account be prepared and have the money in the account But that is not the case for myself nor for many other families getting by living pay check to pay check If I barely have the money to pay my bills I definitely do n t have the extra money to pay fees to any bank including Chase ,Bank account or service

I have had a Macy s credit account for years with no problems as the attached screenshot of my credit record shows About a year ago I made a purchase at one of their stores one of many purchases I made at the holidays I did n t receive a bill but did n t realize it because I d done a lot of shopping and because I deal with a lot of transactions and bills in my position as a business owner In addition I depend on receiving bills so that I remember to pay them Months passed but I never received a bill a call or an email from Macy s despite all of my contact information being readily available I had no idea there was any problem In XX XX 2016 I received a somewhat rude call from Citibank telling me that I owed Macy s money I had no idea what they were talking about and they could not or would not give me any information about why they were calling I actually thought it was a phone scam so unprofessional and unhelpful were they A week or so later I was at a Macy s store and thought I could investigate the problem there No such luck and a call to the general credit department number took me to their 3rd party collections company as soon as my account number was entered Again these folks could n t or would n t tell me anything about my supposed bill A week or two later I was finally able to get someone at Macy s to tell me what I bought where and when why on earth should obtaining this information have been so difficult This person eventually provided me with a mailing address and I sent Macy s a letter and a check for the entire amount less than 100 00 Getting to this point took roughly five calls to Macy s to get someone who a was in this country and understood the situation well enough to do something about it and b would n t send me to back to Collections even when I asked begged her not to send me there again since they could n t or would n t provide me with any details of the transaction As if this were n t bad enough when I checked my credit report last week I saw that this account was reported as delinquent and sent to Collections which has put a big dent in my credit and caused other companies to charge me more for their services I feel this is unfair unwarranted and Macy s should have to repair the damage I did NOT receive a bill from Macy s and was told that once the account balance owed goes past 30 days it s sent to Collections What No email no call no late fee and interest added to next month s bill Then nine months later I get a rude call without any information I can use to figure out what happened And now my credit is damaged and other bills are going up because of it That s not okay ,Credit card or prepaid card

This ordeal began in XX XX XXXX when we had our daughter We fell in love with a pediatrician with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Washington We ended up moving our other XXXX children over to her care also Unfortunately that pediatrician ended up moving shortly after the birth of our daughter so we were in limbo for a few weeks until new doctors joined the establishment Rather than switch offices entirely we were patiently waiting with high hopes that we would find a replacement that would fit our needs just as the previous doctor did We never settled with a primary doctor but instead bounced around between a few different providers with no real preference or opportunity to have a preference Things became increasingly confusing when we switched insurances and at one point became double covered for an extended period of time I was n t sure how the double coverage would affect our co pay and deductibles so I would frequently ask the receptionist how our bill was going to change or if it would change No one could really provide any definite answers After receiving a collection notice in the mail I called and asked to speak with the billing department This happened on many occasions with no real resolution I would continually leave messages with no return phone call We eventually received a letter excusing us from the practice We gladly obliged Not only had XXXX basin excused us from their practice but they also sent us to multiple different collection agencies I received another notice in the mail asking to respond to a court date I responded to the notice not realizing XXXX other collection agencies were also proceeding with court judgments at similar time frames This became overwhelming to say the least Because I did n t understand that multiple agencies were contacting us I only responded to XXXX of the XXXX allowing the others to seek and receive a judgement in their favor This billing issue has ruined our credit caused significant amounts of XXXX and yet continues to haunt us today My husbands check has been garnished multiple times for this by multiple different collection agencies each claiming the SAME debt is owed We are at our wits end and in desperate need of help to finally be done with this horrid ordeal once and for all I ve lost my motivation to fight this unfair and saddening injustice ,Debt collection

I have XXXX issues here First in XXXX 2016 through Wells Fargo s online banking I had accidently pulled out 200 00 as a cash advance really easy to do with their online system no warning that it was a cash advance transfer and not a payment I called in as soon as I realized my mistake same day to request that the cash advance transfer be overturned as I meant to make a 200 00 payment to the credit card After speaking with the representative they told me to go ahead and transfer the 200 00 back to the account and go ahead and make the payment that I originally intended to do I did just that all in the same day I made the 200 00 payment online and even had them initiate the 200 00 reversal over the phone You can see that in the attached statement ending XXXX XXXX 2016 Fast forward to today as this is strictly a balance transfer card I do n t normally check the statements because I do not use the card for purchases it was strictly for the balance transfer offer I did back in XXXX So if we take a snap shot of this statement ending XXXX XXXX 2016 you will see that there was a 200 00 cash advance 200 00 online payment 200 00 phone payment You would think that this would have taken care of everything So we get to my XXXX issue payments made over and above the minimum payment should go towards the highest interest balances first according to the new credit card act Today I was creating some budgeting spreadsheets for my monthly spending and pulling up all my most recent credit card statements and noticed that I had a balance in my Purchase APR bucket in the amount of 170 00 in the statement ending XXXX XXXX 2016 which prompted me to give Wells Fargo a call to figure out why Through no help from them I was able to go back to the XXXX statement and show them that this cash advance should have been a reversal but what really happened was they actually kept it in the cash advance bucket at 24 24 interest then moved it to the purchase bucket in the next statement period all the while charging me that interest What s even more peculiar is that the balance in the cash advance bucket in the statement ending XXXX XXXX 2016 was only 120 00 In the next months statement ending XXXX XXXX 2016 the balance jumped to 140 00 and now showing under the purchase bucket being charged 19 40 interest In my most recent statement the balance again increases to 170 00 and again in the purchase interest bucket at 19 40 After speaking with the supervisor at Wells Fargo what really prompted me to make this complaint is that that not only are they not paying off my high interest rate cards first I ve made 200 00 payments over and above the min 57 00 since XXXX they actually admitted that portions of the payment over the minimum are allocated mostly to high interest cards then some to all other promotional balances This contradicts what the credit card law under the CFPB has published Now if their are nuances to this not spelled out on your website I m ok with that What I m not ok with is how I made a total of 400 00 in payments when the min was 50 00 the day I made the error in making a cash advance for 200 00 on top of all the other payments that I ve made since then 3 months worth of paying over and above the minimum payment and the balance continues to increase each month all the while accruing interest at 19 40 I ve attached all statements dating back to the cash advance error The supervisor was going to see if they could add the balance back to my promotional balance but I do n t really understand why that money is not already paid off all the while being charged high interest for something that they told me was corrected Lastly Wells Fargo be held accountable for not applying payments according to the rules of the credit card act set forth by the CFPB ,Credit card or prepaid card

I applied for a mortgage from BB T bank the first week of XXXX 2016 They had a complete appraisal and a substantially complete application packet by XXXX XXXX Despite my aggressive efforts to answer any questions they might have they did not approve or deny my application by a deadline of two weeks beyond the initial closing date of XXXX XXXX 2016 This date approximately XXXX XXXX 2016 was a deadline at which the seller had the right not to continue the contract The seller stated that they would extend the contract only if I agreed to pay an additional 1400 00 to purchase the house I was forced to agree to the extra 1400 00 because I had already spent approximately 1300 00 on a home inspection an appraisal earnest money and an inspection by a structural engineer the last of which the bank required at my expense As of late XXXX the bank still had not given me an answer As a result I found it necessary to apply at a different company XXXX XXXX mortgage which approved me for a mortgage in less than 30 days BB T representative XXXX XXXX told me that the bank would give me an answer as soon as possible The only official response I have received from the bank is a government required form with a box checked that indicated that the loan was not granted due to insufficient collateral I have asked the bank for an explanation in writing of why the mortgage was not granted As of this date XXXX XXXX the bank has not provided any explanation in writing As a result of this bank s actions and inaction I lost 1400 00 due to the price of the house being raised and I had to pay an additional XXXX months of rent at 510 00 per month due to having to wait XXXX additional months to move into the house I have strong reason to believe that the bank s handling of my mortgage application is part of a pattern of illegal activity undertaken to prevent risk at the expense of mortgage applicants It appears that the bank used an appraiser who went far beyond the appropriate task of an appraiser in order to lowball his appraisal His appraisal of 93000 00 was about 10000 00 less than an appraisal done by XXXX XXXX mortgage which yielded appraisals of 100000 00 and 100000 00 using XXXX different appraisal methods It is my belief that the bank used this lower appraisal amount so that it could deny the loan due to insufficient home to loan value It is also my understanding that this appraiser was not chosen randomly but was chosen specifically for this purchase The mortgage officer involved in this application XXXX XXXX is renowned in this area for extending mortgage application periods to the extent that applicants give up and switch to another company and in so doing incur tremendous expense and or lose the opportunity to purchase homes It is my strong belief that BB T is involved in a pattern of deceptive trade and financial practices designed to insure it against risk while covering up its actions by appearing to give legitimate reasons for denying a loan In my case well after the closing date had passed the bank raised the issue that the house had a carport which was unsafe and needed to be removed but that removing the carport would decrease the home s value to the point where the collateral would not be sufficient to make the mortgage This opinion that the carport was unsafe contradicted the conclusions of a structural engineer which BB T required me to hire and pay for The bank would not allow me or the seller to make any arrangements to remedy the situation nor did they engage in any meaningful dialogue in an effort to resolve the situation and approve the loan XXXX XXXX indicated that the bank had committed wrong and BB T paid for the expense of the appraiser the home inspection and the structural engineer However I have still lost an additional 2400 00 as a result of their conduct ,Mortgage

In XXXX of XXXX I used the XXXX program to refinance my home The purpose of the program was to help lower my payment but without requiring an appraisal because my home s value was and still is lower than the principal balance owed I ended up getting my original loan refinanced and my payment started out being 1900 00 a month Since XXXX my payments have risen to 2300 00 by XXXX of XXXX That s an increase of 410 00 a month in just 3 years My property tax has not risen that much and while my home insurance has risen it has definitely not increased by 4900 00 a year I do n t think banks realize what this does to a person when they only make so much money a year and budget for a monthly home payment when they close on a loan I have complained and inquired about this to Plaza Home Mortgage for the past 2 years and the only response I have ever received from them is that they under estimated my escrow amount to be paid and of course with an offer to pay the difference in full vs monthly yet they made the error in calculating In XXXX of XXXX my home insurance went up by 86 00 a year Over the past 3 months I ve sent a couple of messages to Plaza Home Mortgage reminding them that they need to make sure that when they analyze my escrow payments in XXXX XXXX XXXX they take note that my home insurance is 1800 00 and NOT 1700 00 I just looked at my escrow analysis and they disregarded the messages I ve sent to them and I still show they have my hazard insurance at 1700 00 a year which I believe will result in yet another escrow shortage by XXXX of XXXX I have sent them XXXX messages in the past week and have received NO responses I still have no good explanation of why my payments have gone up 4900 00 a year 410 00 a month I have every reason to believe that Plaza Home Mortgage is doing this same thing to other home loan borrowers and I believe they are making more profit from the loans and not reporting it to the government or something else is going on My suspicion is that they are using home owners equity accounts to make money because they would avoid paying taxes on our equity OR they have grossly miscalculated my annual escrow from the beginning My reason for suspecting this is because of lack of valid proof of the large increase in my monthly loan payment amount and lack of responses from the mortgage company ,Mortgage

I got a target credit card approval while checking out of a Target store XX XX 2015 My first bill was 110 00 which I used the phone payment plan to pay in full on XXXX XXXX 2015 I did not hear a thing until the next month when they sent me a bill with an additional fee attached I called and spoke directly with a person calling herself XXXX who told me that the bank refused the payment due to incorrect account number being submitted by the company It appeared they left out a single zero I corrected the checking account number error with XXXX who repeated it back to me correctly I authorized the payment again over the phone I checked my back account and sure enough the amount I just authorized to be paid to Target was pending on my account Figuring a mistake is a mistake I charged another 100 00 on the target card This time I paid on line and my payment appeared to be accepted However the next month I was changed a late fee again and again my payment had been decline due to inaccurate bank account submission I typed the account number in myself and it was correct I have been charged well over the total amount of my charges for late fees all of which various representatives claimed to have removed I called and spent a great deal of time of the phone with yet another representative I had and still have names of employees their ID numbers dates and even payment confirmation numbers I walked painfully through my practices which included submitting paper checks after payments by phone I even have letters from my financial institution verifying each time a payment was declined the amount was in my account however was not released because TARGET submitted the wrong number Please realize that I have a debit card with target that is directly connected to this same account I had made payments by paper check that indeed when through I had corrected my account information with XXXX employees I walked through the math with the last person I spoke to according to both our math I should have had a credit While speaking with the last Target employee I asked my credit card account be closed I have submitted the same request in writing The last employee I was on the phone XX XX XXXX my dispute would have to be reviewed by the accounting department This accounting department was supposed to contact me by phone with in three business days but I work during business hours and requested a message to be left or an e mail to be sent instead I was assured I would receive both yet I have received neither I have yet another bill with another balance made up not of fees and charges for non payment I am not about to make another payment to this account that should have been closed months ago as it seems the more I pay the more I owe This crooked company is effecting my credit score which would be good if not for my dealing with Target Red cards unsavory business practices I can not believe any company in business can be this incompetent I surmise they purposefully submit incorrect bank account numbers to financial institutions for the purpose of holding credit accounts open and charging various fees and interest Had they gotten my account number correct I would have paid the entire balance of my first change of 110 00 immediately in XX XX XXXX My XXXX change of 100 00 would have been paid in full after two billing cycles therefore minimizing the amount of money they would have made on my account Incorrect bank account number submission for payment after multiple corrections over the phone via the internet use of paper checks and I even have a Target debit card which takes money out of my bank account just fine is a highly unlikely coincidence and a more than likely shady business practice which should be illegal I should not be charged for their mistakes ,Credit card or prepaid card

I submit a complaint yesterday as well In short a garnishment was taken out of my account without me being notified at all from the law firm so my account is currently negative In addition to having all of my funds taken right out of my account I had a legal processing fee for 120 00 on my account causing it to go negative My issue is that my bank should be protecting me and not dipping into my account and taking money that does not exist and then attempting to charge me overdraft fees for them over drafting on my account I have already expressed my concerns with the bank but this needs to be resolved immediately or I will be taking my service elsewhere To me it seems like taking advantage of someone already in a poor financial situation and I will not stand for it Aside from the legal service fee and my bank over drafting on my account I had been informed today that the funds had already been processed and removed from my account for the garnishment I ve done a lot of research and know that legally I am supposed to have a 2 day period where my funds are frozen which did not happen it has not even been 24 hours During this time period I am supposed to receive paperwork for possible exemptions from garnishment from my financial institution which I have not received I check my mail daily and open everything I receive from my bank including bank statements I am fully convinced this is illegal since they have n t taken the necessary steps required by my state to allow someone to garnish money from my bank account I have contacted an attorney regarding this matter This charge was not on my account for this processing fee until yesterday evening whereas some of the transactions that are still processing were from the day prior I also believe the charges were applied to my account incorrectly in an attempt to cause me to incur additional fees and thus for the bank to collect more money from me I am filing this as a follow up complaint to exercise my rights as a consumer and to express my further concerns ,Bank account or service

My loans were recently transfered to Navient sometime in early XXXX from XXXX From XXXX to present my health has been poor and my wealth income even poorer As such I have qualified for IBR repayment plans of 0 00 per month for several years now and with my previous servicer XXXX submitting IBR paperwork usually required a single phone call and a single email After I learned the procedure it took only one yearly email with IBR application and tax return attached I never had to worry that it would n t be processed correctly or approved or whatever But with Navient this summer it has been a root canal to try to push my IBR through inch by inch I ve called customer service many times always diligently asking if there anything more I NEED to do is there anything more I CAN do is there something I am doing wrong The reason I would ask all those questions is Navient never seemed able to know how to process an IBR or sometimes even what an IBR is This echoes the complaints of the states attorneys general so I know that I am not alone I m sorry that I did not take detailed notes of all the phones calls and how much time I spent on the phone nor how much this cost me as I pay for phone service on a minute by minute basis but I had no idea how painful this would be when I started I estimate I have spent 5 hours on the phone and another 3 4 hours on the Internet trying to ensure that my IBR would be processed and it still feels a bit unfinished In addition to profound ignorance of IBR plans they also have special tricks Finally my IBR was seemingly completed this week but even after it was done Navient s last trick was to conjure a late fee that was due to be paid on XXXX XXXX XXXX This late fee was allegedly assessed by my previous servicer back in XXXX and XXXX When I explained that I had months and months and months of emails from XXXX between XXXX and the present that stated that my balance was XXXX Navient was not capable of receiving those emails nor were they interested in receiving them telling me that would have no bearing on their opinion After I escalated my call with the customer service agents to XXXX XXXX this took 45 minutes talking and on hold before an agent told me I could hang up and they would call me back which they did FInally by agent on level XXXX I was promised that a XXXX days process would review my complaint and the agent would REQUEST that the fees be forgiven as a courtesy Patronization in that aside this is just another thing for me to put in my date book and double check later to ensure resolution has been reached correctly and if I lose track of time I m sure I will get another late fee on XXXX XXXX when that payment is due an additional late fee for not paying a fraudulent late fee Thanks for your time I m trying to keep my head above water until Navient is finally shut down by the federal government This is a fraudulent organization A strictly zero profit organization ought to service federally backed student loans ,Student loan

Wells Fargo Home Mortgage engaged in multiple illegal acts against the Uniform Commercial Code and I have provided documented evidence supporting my allegations see my previous CFPB complaint XXXX for entire background and supporting evidence 1 I legally cashed and deposited an escrow refund check issued by Wells Fargo with my name on it The check was NOT issued jointly since there was no AND between the multiple payees myself and my ex husband and my endorsement was fully supported by the Uniform Commercial Code see WF documents to XXXX for cancelled check 2 Wells Fargo subsequently submitted a fraudulent breach of warranty claim to my bank for the escrow refund check as Not Endorsed as Drawn it was clearly Endorsed as drawn according to the Uniform Commercial Code They provided a fraudulent Affidavit of Forged Endorsement with the claim which resulted in the illegal removal of 4200 00 from my bank account on XXXX XXXX 2016 see WF documents to XXXX attachment as evidence This was done even after an internal fraud investigation had been performed by Wells Fargo and the Affidavit of Forged Endorsement signed by my ex husband was confirmed to be false by Wells Fargo documents clearly stating customer states that escrow refund was not cashed by either borrower see Wells Fargo Internal Documents attachment as evidence I was never notified that a forgery claim action was taking place against me or the mortgage account even though I am a co mortgage holder on the account Once aware and after reminding Wells Fargo about the Uniform Commercial Code it appeared as though Wells Fargo was interested in working with me to resolve the issue and fix their mistake of disregarding the Uniform Commercial Code see Fax Cover sheets I sent to WF However it later became apparent that they had already closed the case were wasting my time and were now more concerned about continuing to cover up their own internal flaw of routinely not issuing escrow refund checks jointly The Wells Fargo response to my original CFPB complaint contained numerous reiterated false statements and in addition to their conclusion Based on our research we ve determined your account was handled appropriately and no adjustments are needed was absurd and made it apparent that Wells Fargo does not take this CFPB process or the Uniform Commercial Code seriously see WF response to my CFPB complaint and my detailed dispute attachment refuting their statements and providing clear support for their fraudulent activities and illegal disregard of the Uniform Commercial Code Their response also raised additional serious concerns 1 Wells Fargo attempted to threaten me from using or forwarding internal documents about the closed forgery claim that clearly support my allegations even though these documents were addressed directly to me and faxed upon my request see Wells Fargo faxed cover sheets to XXXX attachment and my detailed dispute attachment refuting this claim 2 The Wells Fargo response now totally contradicts information that was provided to me on a recorded line XX XX 2016 Wells Fargo now states that an escrow refund check was issued jointly on XXXX XXXX 2016 to my ex husband However I was previously told very clearly XX XX 2016 that a duplicate check without an and was issued to him XX XX 2016 It appears that XXXX checks have been re issued XX XX 2016 however there had never been any mention or reference to this jointly issued check until XXXX 2016 and currently no mention of the duplicate check which is quite concerning see my detailed dispute attachment for additional information regarding the initial duplicate check ,Mortgage

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN EQUIFAX continues to violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act willfully by not removing an erroneous Tax Lien showing on my personal credit report I have written them by US Mail twice and they STILL continuously fail to address the situation I called them and their call center has no receipt of the letter I also sent the same letter several times by fax with all my information on it and have given them over 30 days to receive the fax I have contacted the IRS for their advice and they have informed me the best step is to file a Lawsuit to have this erroneous tax lien removed from my credit report As the IRS stated it is now up to Equifax to remove and they further stated that Equifax does have this ongoing problem This is causing substantial harm to my credit report and yet EQUIFAX continues to violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act and will be held liable if this does n t get removed immediately I have also contacted and filed a complaint with the FTC on XXXX XXXX 2016 and also the ATTY General both here in GEORGIA where Equifax maintains their main corporate offices in the United States They have caused me deliberate financial harm by continuously and willfully not adhering to the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation 1 It s documented over 30 days additional written and faxed in disputes have been ignored and thus should be removed Violation 2 Willfully and deliberate continuing to cause financial harm I NEED THIS DELETED IMMEDIATELY EQUIFAX IS NOTORIOUS FOR RESPONDING BY RE INVESTIGATING AN ITEM WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE THEY HAD THEIR TIME TO INVESTIGATE AND IF THEY REPLY BY JUST REINVESTIGATING THE ITEM BY ELECTRONICALLY DOING AN XXXX ELECTRONIC INVESTIGATION AN IMMEDIATE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWSUIT WILL BE FILED Please let this letter serve as final written warning to EQUIFAX if this does not get immediately deleted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,"Credit reporting, repair, or other"
The credit card regarding this complaint is with BankAmericard We received a balance transfer offer with this card which we did use back on XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling 8600 00 plus their transfer fees We took another offer on XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling 3100 00 plus fees Their fees are XXXX of the transfer amount The first offer had no finance charges interest until XXXX XXXX and the second offer we took in XXXX XXXX had no finance charges interest until XXXX XXXX Those XXXX transaction dates were the only ones On XXXX XXXX XXXX I received my monthly statement and noticed a balance adjustment posted to my account and it listed it as a check cash advance We immediately contacted the company and first spoke to XXXX in customer service for almost 50 minutes while she tried to figure out and try to reason with why they have that on the statement While researching this transaction we found out that they did this several times on our monthly statements 8 previous times is the only information she could provide because she only had a certain look back period Since she was flustered with this call and not being able to explain how corrupt the transactions were her supervisor XXXX came on the phone Both representatives were located in the XXXX PA call center since I asked for their Bank of America ID they would not provide me the information Here is the issue every month we make payments to the card and always make MORE than the minimum payment each month They told me that the reason I see on the statements a transaction of a check cash advance is because they have to MANUALLY APPLY MY PAYMENT TO THE FIRST PROMOTION DONE IN XXXX XXXX Being in the legal field I would think maybe that my statement should NOT state that I took a CHECK CASH ADVANCE WHEN WE DID NOT Second problem Bank of America has an added additional amount to our second promotional offer The second offer was a total of 3100 00 in transfers plus the XXXX fee The balance on that offer should still be the 3100 00 plus the 93 00 transfer fee they charge totaling 3200 00 Now since this account is not accruing any interest yet and no payments should be posted to this account yet since they should only be applied to the first promotion how could they explain that they show I owe 3200 00 on the second promotion There should only be a current balance of 3200 00 leaving an overcharge on our account in the amount of 62 00 Does n t seem like much but if they do this to all their customers it will add a profit to Bank of America illegally Since this is the only error I have caught so far I will need to revisit all my statements from the time we opened the account and calculate the payments against what we initially borrowed The supervisor XXXX had some crazy explanation that made no sense and I would invite anyone to listen to the recording of that call which I asked to make sure that the call was being recorded Please investigate Bank of America card services to see if there is some explanation they could provide that makes sense how they added additional debt to our account that we did not use I have a current statement for your review if needed ,Credit card or prepaid card

Currently and since XXXX 2016 my mortgage servicer is listed with Fay Servicing The loan was transferred from XXXX who I had been trying for three years to get approved for the Home Affordable Modification Program Due to a reduction in pay when my organization at work went through a reorganization downsizing sequester furlough days and high rise of property taxes I was unable to keep up my mortgage payments on time which has escalated to XXXX XXXX did a Forebearance on the home loan instead of Home Affordable Modification which should have lowered the current interest rate of 7 5 Instead of helping me to stay in my home and making it more affordable for to stay in my home of seventeen years this made it more difficult for me to make the payments which has made the account delinquent When I was able to bring my account up to date with XXXX the Home Affordable Modification Program was still not processed XXXX was always changing Home Support Specialists and I was always having to resubmit duplicate documents My account was escalated up to the Executive Support Specialist whom I thought the Home Affordable Modification process would be completed but after speaking with him and explaining to him the situation the account was then followed up with another and another Homeowner Support Specialists and the Home Affordable Modification Program was never done and was turned over to Fay Servicing with no communication or my knowledge that XXXX was going to do this Now my mortgage payments have escalated more and Fay Servicing has issued a Pre foreclosure notice for the total delinquent amount due I have to resubmit documents to the Account XXXX and have not been able to contact him to speak with him regarding the status which has prolonged the process and escalation of my loan balance due to the XXXX interest rate still on my account When I was unable to make a high payment on time the Account Manager would not accept a payment later and that is when the notice was issued for the total delinquent amount and he told me my account was in Pre Foreclosure status XXXX and Fay Servicing seems that they are in the business of helping homeowners lose their homes rather than keep them by being slothful negligent in keeping up with documents and not being informative knowledgeable of the Home Affordable Modification Program or just does not care that there are programs in place and are designed to help homeowners keep their homes Out of fraustration and disappointment I have spoke with friends and others who have obtained the Home Affordable Modification Program and the process did not take that long and they received a lower interest rate and were able to make their mortgage payments I am speculating that I am being discriminated against as a single XXXX woman and it is not ideal for me to own a home The advice to look for another institution bank to refinance your home instead of your current servicer is a null and void situation also because another institution or bank is going to take over a delinquent account and if you have a low credit rating due to not being able to pay your debts on time while trying to make your mortgage payments After this complaint I am not sure of the next step to take but want other homeowners to be aware of what s going on and make sure you have a voice in a system that is set up for you to fail and not own a home even if you have worked hard and honestly for many years to have one ,Mortgage

After several weeks of trying to work out the logistics of a return for defective merchandise with a vendor and realizing that we were not getting anywhere with them I contacted Chase in order to dispute the charges with them on XXXX XXXX XXXX I explained the issue and that the vendor had agreed that their merchandise was faulty and that they would take back the item however we would be responsible for expenses associated with the shipping it was a dining table base so it was quite heavy and crating was necessary I gave all the requested information as to dates amounts contact information for the vendor my contact info as well as offered to send video documentation of the defective merchandise The customer service rep stated that a temporary credit would be applied to the account and they would begin the dispute process In XX XX XXXX when reviewing our statement I noticed that this charge had not been applied nor had I received any written information regarding the dispute I called and was told that for some reason the dispute had not been processed and was assured that it would be taken care of It was a month later when I noticed that the temporary chargeback had STILL not been completed so I began following up with Chase regularly to find out why this was taking so long After speaking with supervisors it became apparent that even though we had filed the dispute within the appropriate timeframe since Chase had failed to submit the claim in a timely manner and the window for filing the dispute had passed Over the coming weeks we spent considerable time following up trying to get resolution We explained and they admitted fault that Chase had dropped the ball and had not submitted our claim in time even though we had done everything we were supposed to have done They contacted the vendor who was still willing to take the table back but were still unwilling to negotiate costs associated with shipping which was the reason for our original dispute complaint We were told that the timeframe had passed and since the vendor was willing to work with us Chase was going to close our case This whole experience was very frustrating We did everything we were supposed to do and the ball was dropped not once or twice but more than 3 separate times we had to contact them for a resolution to a dispute which they had done nothing with The only time we received anything in writing regards to this was on XXXX XXXX XXXX when they sent a form letter with inconsistent information and implying that we were going to have the charges that were never removed from the account added back on to our next statement As a result of Chase s negligence in handling this dispute this has cost us thousands of dollars in time and resources to get it back to the vendor in order to get some of the money returned We are a small owned business so this has impacted us We would like Chase to be accountable for the handling of this transaction and make it right ,Credit card or prepaid card

First we tried to resolve the subject dispute with citicards the credit card issuer for several months and could not resolve the issue Briefly we are disputing a charge on our credit card for a purchase where we did not receive the services we purchased We have provided our explanation and related documents to show how the services we purchased were not provided by the merchant to citicards during the course of the dispute process Unfortunately citicards refused to direct our complaints and documents to the relevant merchant and demand an explanation from the merchant regarding our claim Or if citicards indeed have communicated with the merchant regarding this complaint they have failed to provide that communication to us The issue here is that Does a credit card issuer such as citicards have a fiduciary duty to ensure that the charges on a cardholder s account are legitimate and products and services purchased using their credit cards are actually provided And what are the responsibilities that a credit card issuer has when a charge becomes illegitimate and products and services are not provided by the relevant merchant ,Credit card or prepaid card

I have contacted Stearns Lending multiple times to get my escrow adjusted to reflect a property tax exemption from my county First it was to see what information was needed in order to adjust it I submitted the questions through the online contact form I received an email confirming that the request was received however I never heard back I called in after waiting the requested 10 business days and was told that the county needed to send them a form When I asked for the form they said that the county is the one who has it I called my county who had no clue what is was but offered to write a letter confirming the property tax exemption on the property for my service XXXX veteran husband This letter included all the information on my property including the estimated tax bill for 2016 On XX XX XXXX I submitted this letter through the same secured form online and got a confirmation that they received my request and it asked for XXXX business days to review and research it On XX XX XXXX I called in because I again never heard a response from the company I was told that they denied my request for Escrow Adjustment because I did n t submit an actual tax bill When I explained that tax bills do not get issued until XX XX XXXX they said that they can not go off of the county s estimated tax bill I questioned this because they are currently withholding the escrow based off an estimation and not an actual tax bill The answer was still no they would not adjust my escrow based off of my tax exemption This puts a large strain on my monthly cash flow because the difference in escrow is about 150 00 a month I also questioned why I was not informed that the request was denied I literally had no communication back from Stearns lending after I submitted the request I was told that I submitted the wrong form I questioned how that was possible considering that I used their form online I never got a clear answer The agent I spoke with was agent XXXX I d love someone to review this call because it truly was bizarre I m appalled that a company who is holding VA mortgages is not more familiar with tax exemption available to XXXX Veterans Also this is the not first time I ve had issues getting my escrow adjusted When I switched insurance policies I had to submit the request 4 times before it actually was done Each time I called I was informed that they never received the information There is a systemic issue with bad service and communication at this company ,Mortgage

Starting in about XXXX 2015 I started wondering why my account had not gone down in 10 years It had only gone down 800 00 in 9 years I had made extra payment amounts from the beginning I made 450 00 payments for almost 2 years None of the extra 40 00 made it to my Principal Attached doc They were used just for interest For many years I was under the impression that this loan was like any other loan it s a set amount and it does n t matter when you pay it as long as you are not late I was making XXXX payments at XXXX time sometimes little did I know that this loan does n t work that way You have to make a payment every 30 days on the dot or you will be charged interest since you were over 30 days So making payments early and then making double payments actually cost me money because the next payment was not due for 45 days So I would be charged XXXX more days of interest I have since figured this out I also noticed that when I would pay extra that the extra amount would be taken off of my next payment amount EX XXXX would go down to XXXX Eventually my monthly payment would be 0 00 and they would say I do n t need to make a payment So I did n t What they were doing was taking my extra payment amounts and showing I was prepaying interest They should have gone to reduce principal Then if I did n t make the payment they would then charge me another 30 days interest Most of my concern is that I am trying to pay this loan off in 3 years I want to make big payments to get my principal down So since XXXX 2015 I have been working on this and testing the system to make sure payments are being applied correctly I would make 500 00 payments and those payments would all go to interest or just be applied wrong I have attached information so you can see how they posted the payments You will see that I had to call back and have them re do the payment allocations every month they were applying my extra payments to prepaid interest I have a script that I have to say to them each time See below I talk to someone different every time They do not apply the payments correctly And this week they lost XXXX of my extra payments I made the payment over the phone on XXXX XXXX 2015 and the lady said it was good to go I had to use my script near the bottom of this document to make sure she does it right Many people have said to me you need to do this exactly And I have done everything they have said I got an account with them to make sure the payments were coming out on time I also say exactly what they want me to say I then have to go into the account the next day to see if they applied the payments correctly Why am I working so hard to make sure they do this right Should n t they have this I was told multiple times from the people on the phone that they have to make these changes all day long These loans are bad and the system can not handle the loans They also told me to do the payments using the new Online Payment application That system also takes my payments and then prepays the interest This is not working either So I went back to calling the loan servicing number And that is when they screwed up my payment for 280 00 It has now been 8 days and that amount is not showing on my loan They did take the money out of my account but I have not seen it They said it went into another account Not sure if it was my account or someone else s I have talked to multiple people and they could not find the 280 00 See below the events by day I did involve the XXXX I am working with XXXXXXXXXXXand he suggested that I contact your office XXXX did get me in contact with a XXXX Retail Lending XXXXXXXXXXX See attachments for more info that comes after this ,Mortgage

My Chase Mortgage Statement has XXXX payment options I was reviewing the option to pay the mortgage off in 20 years but the payment amount indicated on the mortgage statement did n t make sense I manually calculated the payment and came up with a payment roughly 2000 00 less each month I checked and rechecked assuming I made a mistake Then I phoned Chase the customer service agent pulled up her copy of my statement and insisted the statement was correct As we continued the conversation I explained what I thought was incorrect and eventually she manually calculated the payment herself and admitted the statement had bad information However this loan has been an interest only loan so the principal amount has been about the same throughout the last nine years She then went on to tell me the 20 year amortization is actually based on 12 years I questioned that since the statement says it s based on 20 years but she said the calculation was fixed at the time of origination and that would have been the payment if we had started making the 20 year payment at the time of origination That does n t make any sense and is misleading There is still 21 years left on the mortgage and basically no principal has been reduced so 20 years should be 20 years and not 12 I think their making excuses for a glitch in their mortgage statement and instead of admitting it was an error they re trying to say 20 is actually 12 years ,Mortgage

Letter from LawyerWe have completed an examination of your bankruptcy case and spoken with our lawyer It appears to us that the firm has done nothing which has injured you Understanding our position requires some understanding of a complicated and in some ways confusing set of laws relating to the bankruptcy and the real estate which you own Your state has an exemption for a certain amount of equity in real estate That is to say in a bankruptcy the creditors can not sell your residence to satisfy their judgment if you have less equity in the home than the amount of the exemption The bankruptcy court can only order a creditor whose judgment has matured into a lien on your property to release that lien if you have equity in the real estate and that equity is less than the amount of the exemption provided under your state s laws The problem here is that at the time of your bankruptcy you had no equity in the house That is to say the amount of the mortgage was equal to or greater than the fair market value of the home Under those circumstances the court can not enter an order to avoid the lien of the judgment There was nothing that could have been done to get the court to do that We attach hereto a copy of the Court s opinion on our motion to avoid the lien which states what I have just told you While there was n t a motion filed during your bankruptcy to avoid the lien the Court has made it clear that it would have denied such a motion in any event This does n t mean that you still owe the money to that creditor You do n t The judgment and the debt are discharged The creditor can not take any action against you to collect the debt or enforce the lien You should be able to refinance your mortgage without worry merely by showing the lender that you received a discharge in bankruptcy I hope this is helpful and that you will be able to fulfill your economic plans in the future ,Debt collection

Hi I have a circle checking account XXXX XXXX XXXX with Citizens bank I recently visited a branch XX XX XXXX to deposit a check and during that visit was told that my account is dormant Apparently since XX XX XXXX up to this point due to my account being inactive I have been charged monthly fee of 5 00 Since XX XX XXXX was Saturday the manager at that branch was not able to answer questions on when did my account started being dormant why there has been no communication from bank about it I went to my regular branch XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about my account I wanted to check why bank have NOT notify me in anyway about changes to my account status from active to dormant I also did not receive any notification that I will be charged fees for keeping this account The bank representative told me that I have eStatements and if I have logged in and checked my balance I would notice that I am being charged fees I may have logged in to the account but I believe bank eStatement are different that receiving notification from bank about account change In my opinion I should have received letter sent to my home address notifying me about charges that I will be occurring for keeping this account I logged in today and tried to see if bank send me any notification via their system but since they started charging me XX XX XXXX I am not able to review any information see attached for showing no eNotices on my account The representative in the bank said that they can not see any communication on my account but eStatements Attached is my XX XX XXXX eStatement I do not see any explanation of those dormant charges there is a note saying that I can waive a 15 00 maintenance fee if I keep certain balance on the account see attached however I do not think this applicable to my account However there is no information what the dormant account means when it started and what I have to do as customer to avoid this fee I think this falls into UDaP unfair and Deceptive practice since bank did not notify customer of charges to the account Yes I could have logged in to the account to check my statement but I think with such substantial change of the account terms there should have been a courtesy letter sent to my home address to notify me There also should have been better explanation of the charge why am I being charged this and what I can do to stop being charged this fee I am very disappointed that bank would take 95 00 dollars from my account I can not believe that bank would charge me for 19 months a set fee and would not notify me I know that they have correct correspondence address on the account since they sent me a new ATM card If I would have not go to the bank to deposit a check I would continue to be unaware of diminishing account founds At what point would bank notify me about the charges when I would run out of money Please advise of best way to receive refund of those charges In my belief my account should have 550 00 not 450 00 How do I go about receiving 95 00 back into my account I appreciate you looking into my case When I visited the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch XX XX XXXX I was informed that I should have received a letter from the bank notifying me about upcoming charges and that I should have signed it and return it to the bank The bank was looking into archive to determine if they have a copy of signed letter in their records as I do not recall receiving and signing such letter As of today XX XX XXXX I have not heard back from bank about their research Thank you for your help in resolving this case ,Bank account or service

Dear officer I was provided a very competitive 30 yr fixed mortgage quote by AFN when I first started searching for lender We were given GFE and numbers and interest rate shown on the GFE were very promising Based on those numbers we decided to proceed with AFN During the loan process interest rates went up and I asked AFN to provide both 30 yr and 15 yr loan option to us Comparing those XXXX options I decided to proceed with 15 yr loan I requested AFN representative branch manager on phone to confirm the lender credit to which he confirmed to me that credit will be XXXX of the loan amount Also confirmed lender credit in the email After this discussion when the loan was approved AFN never sent me any documents directly as should have been done Instead I received a call from XXXX that what time I can be available to sign the paper work I was shocked but had to keep moving forward as we would have lost the house if we did n t close the loan So I requested the escrow company to mail me soft copy of the HUD so I can confirm numbers and know what I am going to sign When I received the copy through email from XXXX to my surprise numbers were not matching I called and emailed AFN and mentioned it to them They never responded to my email on that specific question but next day on phone AFN representative told me escrow did all the numbers wrong and they have sent escrow a new copy Again this time around also I was not sent anything directly from AFN so I again requested XXXX to please send me the new documents so I can verify numbers before I sign them After receiving the documents I checked and although numbers were changed they did n t match the numbers we talked and credit was significantly less then discussed Since we were in a tough spot I went ahead and confirmed to AFN through email that I am signing the document and we can get the numbers corrected in the closing documents Again there was no official response from AFN to my email on this topic They will communicate with me on other topics but not on the numbers and as matter of fact none of the HUD documents were sent to me by the company directly and I had to request escrow time and again to send the documents Hud documents have a column where it shows comparison to GFE in my case that clearly shows an increase of 44 84 while stating that numbers can not increase by more than 10 I believed that once the lender corrects the credit numbers will match So I waited for loan to close and to receive final check from XXXX after receiving the final check after closing it became clear to me that AFN has not corrected any numbers I stared communicating with them about the situation and at one point was told by AFN representative that I signed the paper so I agreed At this point I realized that they are not dealing fairly and bumped up the numbers knowing that I did n t have an option to contest as the house was on the line to get the loan closed I am reaching out to you to make this wrong a right I am hoping that this kind of behavior of pushing the borrower with arbitrary credit and closing cost and lack of information is stopped I am optimistic that after the resolution of my case AFN will improve its practices with other borrowers Resolution to me would be Refunds me the amount they owe me and commit to more transparent approach towards borrowers ,Mortgage

I have XXXX complaints about USAA mortgage services The first I m concerned that I may have overpaid in interest The second has to do with how USAA unilaterally applies additional mortgage payments to principal interest and escrow and the third has to do with their use of mortgage servicers to manage their mortgages and their lack of accountability or responsibility to their members when using the mortgage servicers For the first issue I sent three additional mortgage payments that were to be applied to the principal only In each instance USAA applied the additional payment to the principal interest and escrow I contacted USAA to correct the payments with the exception of the last payment I have n t yet been able to reach the mortgage servicer As interest is determined by the value of the loan the interest rate and number of days I m concerned that I ve overpaid in interest I was assured by USAA that the payment corrections would be dated back to the date the money was received however it does n t appear that the corrections were The first payment was made XXXX XXXX 15 but was not corrected until XXXX XXXX 15 The second payment was made XXXX XXXX 15 but the correction was not made until XXXX XXXX 15 Unfortunately because of my work schedule and USAA s mortgage servicer business hours I ve not yet been able to reach them to correct the third payment Additionally the second issue on the third payment I made it very clear that the payment was to be applied to the principal only I wrote in all caps and highlighted PRINCIPAL ONLY on the check and money orders I selected principal only on the payment coupon and included the value that was to be applied to the principal Still USAA applied the amount to the principal interest and escrow despite my express written desire that the entire amount be applied to the principal only For the third issue I contacted USAA about correcting the third payment and they directed me to their mortgage servicer The mortgage servicer s business hours differ from USAA s business hours So I called USAA back and explained the mortgage servicer was closed for the day USAA offered to give me the mortgage servicer s direct phone number so that I could call them directly when they were open for business I explained to USAA its extremely difficult for me to contact the mortgage servicer because of my work hours and that my mortgage contract was directly with USAA not the mortgage servicer I had no desire to work with their mortgage servicer The agreement with the mortgage servicer was between USAA and the mortgage servicer My agreement was directly with USAA and I did n t want to contact a third party to correct a payment relative to the agreement between USAA and myself USAA was unable to help and insisted I contact their mortgage servicer I sent an email complaint to USAA about it and received no resolution ,Mortgage
